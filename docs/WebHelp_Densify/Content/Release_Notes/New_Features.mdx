<Accordion title="Densify 14.7.0 - December 14, 2022">
<Accordion title="Routing and Reservation Updates">
Two significant updates have been made to the route and reserve features in this release:

* During routing of incoming workloads, any clusters that are undergoing sensor data recalculation (i.e. sensor capacity data is not available) are now excluded from consideration as a hosting option. This ensures that valid sensor capacity data is used when making routing decisions. See [Working with Sensors](../Control_Console/Working_with_Sensors#Sensor_Recalc).
* You now have the option to select a sensor "fill and spill" placement strategy for routed workloads. In addition to the existing balancing strategy that distributes incoming workloads across all suitable datastores, you now have the option to fill a datastore and then move to the next one. You can specify a sensor placement strategy when submitting a routing request (via the API) or you can define the strategy globally using a configuration setting. See [Working with Sensors](../Control_Console/Working_with_Sensors#Placement).

Also see [Routing Requests](https://densify.com/docs-api/WebHelp_Densify_API/Content/API_Guide/Routing_Requests#Placement) in the Densify API documentation.

<Accordion title="Security Updates">
This release includes a number of security updates.

* User Access upon Account Deactivation--When user accounts are deactivated or deleted, any existing sessions for that user are terminated on the server-side to prevent unauthorized use of the application. The same applies for situations where a user loses higher access privileges.
* User Account Notifications--The existing feature has been enhanced to send a notification when a user changes their email address or password. In the event of an email address change, a confirmation message is sent to the original email address.
* Browser Caching--Sensitive content is no longer cached by setting the "no-store" directive in the Cache-Control response in the HTTP headers. These changes to the Cache-Control response in the HTTP headers mean that you will likely have to clear your browser cache more frequently than before. This change will make the UI more responsive.
