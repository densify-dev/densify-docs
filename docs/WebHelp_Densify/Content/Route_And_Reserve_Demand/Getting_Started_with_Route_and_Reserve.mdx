As a valuable tool to help you efficiently respond to capacity requests, the Route and Reserve Demand page provides an intuitive way of viewing and managing incoming and outgoing workloads as it allows you to both route booking requests immediately to the best environment as well as view and reserve capacity in your environment in the future. Through the Route and Reserve Demand page, you can see immediately if the requirements of an incoming booking request, such as hosting platform, VM size, and OS, can be met with the capabilities of any available hosting venue. Booking requests can be routed automatically to the highest-rated hosting venue based on both the Densify Hosting Score metric and datastore capacity, or they can be routed manually to the hosting venue of your choice.

The Route and Reserve Demand page makes routing new booking requests in hosting venues easier with its Hosting Score metric that rates the suitability of target environments for new VM placements based on available space, relative cost and fit for purpose criteria. Booking capacity reservations are created once a request is routed to a hosting venue. These bookings are essential when modeling future capacity so you understand the demands on your environment, allowing you to better plan any new infrastructure purchases and deployments to support new application workloads.
