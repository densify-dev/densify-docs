The Hosting Venues pane shows the hosting venues defined in Densify. This pane is used to determine the best hosting venue to manually and automatically route your booking requests. Only those hosting venues displayed are evaluated for routing.

Details for each hosting venue is shown in its own tile of the Hosting Venues pane at the right side of the screen by default. When you click to the Manage Reservations screen, the same Hosting Venues pane is displayed on the left with the Reservation Details pane displayed on the right.

The Hosting Venue tile shows the server model name and icon in the bottom-left area of the tile and the hosting platform in the bottom right. You can search for specific hosting venues using the Filters box and the Routing Preference routing strategy, and control how they are sorted using the Options button. For more information, see [Filtering and Sorting Hosting Venues](./Filtering_and_Sorting_Hosting_Venues).

The following buttons expand or collapse hosting venue tiles:

</Accordion>


1. Expands or collapses the tile for this hosting venue. When the hosting venue is collapsed, the status and available space amount are shown in the heading. If the hosting venue is being evaluated for a booking request, the score is shown in the heading.
2. Expands or collapses all hosting venues.

## Hosting Venue Tile Overview

The information shown in each hosting venue tile is dependent both on your user preferences and whether the hosting venue is in a scored or unscored state. A score is derived after clicking Evaluate Hosting Options to evaluate a set of booking requests against the displayed hosting venues for the specified criteria--the better the fit, the higher the score. When you initially navigate to the Route and Reserve Demand page, all hosting venues are unscored, showing either Open or Closed.

<Accordion title="Figure: Hosting Venue Tile Overview">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Reservation_Console_Guide/030047.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


## Tile Colors

The Hosting Venue tiles are color coded by platform (e.g. internal virtual, internal physical, external public cloud vendors such as AWS, Google and Azure). In this way, you can quickly identify the platform categories.

The colors align with the logos, as shown below.

<Accordion title="Figure: Tile Colors">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Reservation_Console_Guide/030055.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


## Status

A hosting venue is marked as Open if it is accepting new booking requests and marked as Closed if it is not accepting new booking requests. A hosting venue can be closed for several reasons, including:

* An administrator manually modifying the hosting venue to not allow new VM bookings,
* The hosting venue being disqualified due to analysis errors or missing benchmarks, or
* The hosting venue reaching a percentage of under-provisioned VMs or hosts.

For more information on unavailable hosting venues, see [Unavailable Hosting Venues](#Unavaila).

If the hosting venue is not fit for purpose (based on resource, business, security and technical details), the hosting venue is marked as Rejected.

<Note>
Although you can force a new workload into a rejected hosting venue, you cannot force a workload into a closed hosting venue.
</Note>



## Unscored Hosting Venues and Capacity Unit Measurements

If you have Display Available Space/Unit Cost selected in the Options window, the Available Space value is calculated based on the values entered for the capacity unit (also set in the Options window). The Route and Reserve Demand page uses this capacity unit's CPU, memory and storage values along with its workload profile to calculate how many times it can fit within the hosting venue and reports this as Available Space, essentially this provides the number of availble slots.

If you select a routing strategy that includes a cost amount (relative cost, blended), the unit cost is included as well.

<Accordion title="Figure: Unscored Hosting Venue with Unit Cost and Available Space">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Reservation_Console_Guide/030029_449x132.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


* To change the capacity unit used by the Route and Reserve Demand page, click Options and enter the required values in the Capacity Unit section.

If your routing strategy is set to the default value of capacity, the unit cost is not shown. Also if you do not want to calculate available space for each hosting venue, you can clear the Display Available Space/Unit Cost option.

## Unavailable Hosting Venues

When the hosting venue tile shows closed, it is unavailable for new guest bookings. The following situations prevent you from routing booking requests to a hosting venue:

## Hosting Venue Tiles for Internal Hosting Venues

Hosting venue tiles show different information depending on whether the hosting venues are in an unscored or scored state. The following table shows information that is shown in unscored and scored states as well as the common information that is displayed regardless of the state:

## Hosting Venue Tiles for External Hosting Venues

For external hosting venues, the tiles are similar to internal hosting venues with some exceptions. Typically external venues are intended to model cloud providers.

For external hosting venues (with potentially infinite capacity), only the capacity routing strategy applies. Hence, for the unscored state, Unit Cost is always 0 and Available Space is always Unlimited (sorted as the largest value).

<Accordion title="Figure: Unscored with Unit Cost and Available Space">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Reservation_Console_Guide/030048_483x193.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Figure: Unscored Collapsed">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Reservation_Console_Guide/030051_485x47.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


For the scored state, Hosting Score is 100% as long as the hosting venue passes the Fit-for-Purpose requirements (or 0 otherwise), Relative Cost is always 0 and Required Space is always 0% of available capacity.

## Displaying Top Constraints

The hosting venue's top five constraints, ordered with the top constraint first, is displayed when you click on the Available Space/Required Space area of the Hosting Venue tile.

When clicking on Available Space, the constraints are listed by the number of times the capacity unit VM fits into this hosting venue's available space. e.g. 49 VMs fit into the available CPU Utilization for the example shown below.

When clicking on Required Space, the constraints are listed by percentage of this hosting venue's available space. e.g. 6% of the available space is required for Total Memory.
