The Route and Reserve Demand page has two screens--the Route Demand screen showing the booking requests to be routed and the Manage Reservations screen showing the bookings already routed. When you navigate between screens, the timeline and the Hosting Venues pane do not change.

When the Route and Reserve Demand page is first displayed, the Route Demand screen is displayed.

Using the Manage Reservations link, you can navigate to the Reservation Details pane to view the bookings already routed.

The four main sections of these two screens are:

* Action Bar--This section at the top contains action buttons to Add, Edit and Delete from the Route Demand screen, and to View, Unroute and Export from the Manage Reservation screen. For more information on these action buttons, see [Defining Booking Requests](./Defining_Booking_Requests) and [Provisioning Workloads](./Provisioning_Workloads).
* Booking Requests To Be Routed--All booking requests are listed in this pane. Booking requests are grouped by project and are listed under this group heading. One or more booking requests can be dragged onto a hosting venue in the Hosting Venues pane to route the booking to that group. Alternatively, the bookings requests can be auto routed. For more information on the Booking Requests To Be Routed, see [Viewing the Booking Requests to be Routed Pane](./Viewing_the_Bookings_Requests_To_Be_Routed_Pane).
* Hosting Venues--Lists the details of the hosting venues in your environments, including both internal and external hosting venues. This pane shows open hosting venues (accepting workloads) and closed hosting venues (marked as not allowing new VMs) in an unscored state, and open and rejected (not fit for purpose) in a scored state. You can filter and sort the list as required. This list of hosting venues does not change when you navigate back and forth between the Route Demand and the Manage Reservation screens. For more information, see [Viewing the Hosting Venues Pane](./Viewing_the_Hosting_Venues_Pane).
* Reservation Details--Shows details for all guest bookings after the booking requests have been routed to hosting venues. For more information, see [Viewing the Reservation Details Pane](./Viewing_the_Reservation_Details_Pane).

The Route and Reserve Demand page uses the time zone of the Densify server to filter the list of bookings displayed, and then to evaluate and route booking requests. All dates are shown and stored based on the serverâ€™s time zone, including the timeline and planned dates of booking requests.
