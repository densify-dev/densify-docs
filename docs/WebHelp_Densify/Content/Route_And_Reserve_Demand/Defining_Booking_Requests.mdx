title: "Defining Booking Requests"
---

Booking requests can be created manually from within the Route Demand screen of the Route and Reserve Demand page.

Booking requests have a profile strength that indicates how much information has been captured about the booking request. The more details that you add when you create the booking request, the higher the profile strength. See [How the Profile Strength is Calculated](./Viewing_the_Bookings_Requests_To_Be_Routed_Pane#How) for details.

## Creating Booking Requests

When creating a new booking request, a set amount of mandatory information needs to be entered to enable proper routing, for instance selecting a reference system that is used to populate several values in the booking request, such as the required vCPUs, memory and OS. Other information about the booking request can also be populated to ensure the booking is routed to the ideal hosting venue and to enforce specific policy rules during placement and rebalancing, such as keeping load balancing members and security zones apart based on the load balancing group and security zone specified. This type of information can also be inherited if it has been included with a reference system.

To begin defining your booking request, navigate to the Route and Reserve Demand page to the Route Demand screen. Click Add. The New Guest Booking Request dialog box is displayed and needs to be defined, section by section.

A workload profile is a model used for characterizing the expected utilization levels and patterns for multiple resource types, and a workload type is a resource utilization metric associated with a single system or a group of systems. You need to select a workload profile and type for the booking request that best reflects this new VM so the required resources are accurately calculated for this new workload.

Each profile, such as Memory Intensive, Medium Utilization, etc. has several associated workload types, i.e. CPU utilization and Disk I/O Operations. Review the available profiles in the following table. Review their corresponding workload charts to determine which option to use for your bookings.

## Editing Booking Request Details

After the booking request has been created but is still unrouted, you can select and then Edit all details for the request except for the reference system.

To learn more watch the video:

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="vidyard_iframe" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/301299587" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="630"></iframe>



## Editing One or More Booking Requests

You can edit multiple booking requests at the same time.

Select the specific projects or the specific booking requests, using the standard SHIFT or CTRL key for multi-select. If different values have been entered previously for different booking requests, the field will show "multiple values". Any value that you enter will overwrite any value previously entered.

<Accordion title="Figure: Multiple Values for Different Booking Requests">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Reservation_Console_Guide/030039_495x240.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


## Routing from the Booking Request Dialog Box

If you know the environment and hosting venue where you want to place the new booking request, you can route the booking request directly from the New/Edit Guest Booking Request dialog box.

After the Preferred Environment and Preferred Hosting Venue are specified, click the Route button. If the hosting venue is suitable for hosting the booking request, it is routed to that group. The booking is then moved to the Reservation Details pane.

## Deleting Booking Requests

You can select and Delete multiple booking requests at the same time.
