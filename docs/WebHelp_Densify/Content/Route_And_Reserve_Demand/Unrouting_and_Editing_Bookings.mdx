title: "Unrouting and Editing Bookings"
---

If you want to edit or reroute bookings, you have to first unroute them. Inbound guest bookings in any state displayed in the Reservation Details pane can be unrouted and sent back to the Booking Requests to be Routed pane. From this pane, they can be edited and routed to a different hosting venue.

When you unroute, the assigned guest placement answer is removed and the status changes back to Draft.

<Note>
You can always edit the system name when the booking is in a Pending Commit, Committed or Late state without having to unroute it first.

## Step 1: Defining Your Booking Scope

To find the bookings you want to unroute, you can optionally filter the Reservation Details pane to make the bookings easier to find. You can filter using the timeline and/or the filter dropdowns, as appropriate. See [Filtering Bookings Using the Timeline Slider](./Viewing_the_Reservation_Details_Pane#Filterin), [Filtering Routed Bookings Using the Filter Dropdown](./Viewing_the_Reservation_Details_Pane#Filterin2) and [Filtering and Sorting Hosting Venues](./Filtering_and_Sorting_Hosting_Venues).

For example, to unroute by project, you can update the Group Filter to filter the bookings specific to your project.

## Step 2: Unrouting Bookings

1. In the Reservation Details pane, select the bookings to unroute.
2. Click the Unroute button in the toolbar.
3. Click OK in the confirmation box.

The booking is removed from the hosting venue and is returned to Draft state as a booking request. If the booking was Late, the Planned Start Date is reset to today.

4. The booking is moved to the Booking Requests To Be Routed pane.

## Step 3: Editing Booking Requests

1. Click on the Route Demand link.
2. In the Booking Requests To Be Routed pane, select the booking request(s) to edit.
3. Click the Edit button. See [Defining Demand](./Defining_Demand) to edit and then re-route.
