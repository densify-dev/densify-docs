There are a number of features within the Spectrum that facilitate the ongoing management of your environments.

## Dragging and Dropping Systems

<Note>
When using the simplified version of the Control Console in browsers other than Internet Explorer some features may not be available. See [Control Console Spectrum Overview](./Control_Console_Spectrum_Overview).
</Note>



You can select one or more systems in order to access specific Spectrum functionality Once selected, the system dots increase in size. You can now drag them to the required option on the pop-up drop zone pane. The pop-up pane is displayed when you begin dragging the selected systems. After you drag the selected systems to the appropriate drop zone option, a dialog box is displayed to configure and confirm the requested operation.

Depending on the scope of your selection (environment, infrastructure groups, hosts and/or VMs), the icons in the drop zone pane will differ. Only the options that are applicable to the type of selection are provided. If options are not valid for the access control, they are displayed but disabled (i.e. showing in gray).

Specifically, the steps to perform a drop zone operation are:

1. Determine the environment, infrastructure group, or group of hosts and VMs you want to select. Optionally, zoom into the area of the spectrum containing the systems you want to select. As you hover over a system, the system name is displayed.
2. Drag the mouse around the systems to be selected. You can select systems that are not adjacent, by holding down the Ctrl key, while selecting the various systems. As you select the systems, the corresponding dot is enlarged for easier viewing. You can specify the desired dot size. See [Shortcut Keys](./Shortcut_Keys). Click anywhere in the Spectrum to deselect the whole group and then reselect, as necessary.
3. Drag the selected systems towards the top of the Spectrum. As you begin dragging, the drop zone pops up. Alternatively, press F2 to keep the drop zone on top of the Spectrum. It will not disappear.
4. Drag the systems to one of the drop zone options and release the mouse button. The corresponding dialog box is displayed.
5. Click the Systems tab to see the list of selected systems. Verify these are the required systems. De-select any systems that you do not want to select.
6. Click OK to execute the selected operation.

With the Control Console, you can perform the following operationd using the drop zone:
