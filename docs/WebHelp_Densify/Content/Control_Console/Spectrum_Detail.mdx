title: "Spectrum Detail"
---

When you select one or more systems in the Spectrum, you can see more information about them including the system details, recommendations and metrics using the option in the Spectrum Details pane.

<Note>
When using the simplified version of the Control Console in browsers other than Internet Explorer some features may not be available. See [Control Console Spectrum Overview](./Control_Console_Spectrum_Overview).
</Note>



The following features, specific to the Spectrum Detail pane are only available for advanced users when using a supported version of Internet Explorer:

* The System Dashboard button opens the system summary dashboard. All dashboard tabs and buttons are available for advanced users only, as are the link to set benchmark overrides and the links to parent and child systems.
* The Action Plan Manager button, located on the right side of the Spectrum Detail pane;
* Resource Utilization Metrics tab--The workload charts displayed here utilize the new "candle stick" format. When you open the Workload Viewer using the Workload Viewer button, the chart uses the previous box-plot format.
* Within the Spectrum Details pane, all hyperlinks to other systems, where available in the various tabs, are available for advanced users only.

</Accordion>


When viewing the Spectrum Detail, if all the tabs do not fit in your browser window, an arrow at each end of the tab title bar allows you to slide the tabs left or right into view. Another arrow at the end of tab title bar displays a popup list from which you can pick a specific tab.

## Selected Systems in the Spectrum

The Spectrum Detail area is populated with details for the systems you select in the Spectrum:

* If you select an infrastructure group then the details for all of the contained hosts and VMs are displayed.
* If you select a host then the details for the host and all contained VMs are displayed.
* If you select a sensor then the details just for the sensor are displayed.
<Note>
The sensors for datastores are unique to the Control Console package for VMware.
</Note>

* If you select a group of systems by dragging the selection box or by using Ctrl + click to select multiple systems, then the details for only the selected systems are displayed, and not their contained child-systems.
* If you can navigate to another control environment, the selected tab does not change. This allows you to easily view the information for a specific tab across environments.

## Spectrum Detail Tabs

Depending on what systems are selected within the Spectrum, the Spectrum Detail shows the corresponding tabs that apply to that selection (i.e. whether an environment (E), infrastructure group (G), host (H), VM (V), or sensor (S)).

## Resource Utilization Metrics Tab

This tab shows two sets of charts: those generated for both the high (red) and the low (yellow) limits.

The resource utilization metrics are displayed for both conditions, too much infrastructure and for too little infrastructure. This allows you to view all metrics and analyses for potential resource violations from the results of both the over-provisioned and the under-provisioned analyses.

A dividing line separates the over-provisioned and the under-provisioned charts. Use the right/left arrows to move forward and back through the displayed charts. As you roll-over the chart, a larger view is displayed. Double-click the chart to launch the Workload Viewer for that system.

If the selected system is in the red, then the under-provisioned (red zone) charts are shown first and over-provisioned (yellow zone) are shown after the divider. For the case where you have a VM in the yellow the spectrum is displayed like the following with low limit charts first since they resulted in the VM being placed in the yellow.
