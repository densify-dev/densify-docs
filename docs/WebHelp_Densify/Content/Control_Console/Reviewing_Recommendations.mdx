## Reviewing Today’s Recommendations

1. In the Control Console select an environment in the Environment Navigator.

The spectrum is displayed for the selected environment. The Spectrum Detail, shown as the bottom of the screen, shows the recommendations for today, for the environment. The number in brackets in the title of the tab indicates the number of recommendations for the selected entity. If you select an infrastructure group, host, VM or sensor, the list of recommendations is updated to display only the items for that selected entity.

This is also applicable if you select a group of entities in the Spectrum by dragging the mouse. The displayed list of recommendations is updated to show detailed information only for those selected entities. This is also the case when the Reveal feature is used to filter the entities displayed in the Spectrum. Only the recommendations for the selected entities are shown in Spectrum Details. See [Working with the Spectrum](./Working_with_the_Spectrum).

<Accordion title="Figure: Recommendations for \<Selected Day> Tab">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_DCI-Control_Guide/0300001C_570x159.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>
2. Review the recommendations on this tab. You can use the scroll bar to review the complete list of recommendations. You can enlarge the Spectrum Detail pane by dragging the top border upwards.
3. There are a number of columns in this tab. Click on any column to sort the list by the selected criteria, in ascending or descending order. The column header, used for sorting, is indicated with an up or down arrow head.
<Accordion title="Figure: Sorting Listed Recommendations">

</Accordion>


When the spectrum is run initially, a large number of recommendations may be generated. It is highly recommended that you filter the list according to your specific requirements, in order to view a more manageable list of recommendations.

## Recommendations for \<Selected Day> Tab Details

The following columns are displayed in Recommendations for \<Selected Day> tab:

## Filtering the Spectrum Based on the Recommendations

You can filter the recommendations list by system. Right-click a recommendation for the system of interest and select Filter Action. Both the recommendation list and the spectrum are filtered to display the system and its parent and child systems and the recommendations associated with the selected system. The details of the filter, i.e. \<GroupLabel>, Host and/or VM names are used to populate the filter criteria, located above the spectrum.

Click the Reset button to clear the filter. You can also press F10 to clear the filter.

</Accordion>


## Viewing Recommendation Details

Double-click a recommendation (or right-click View Details) to open the Recommendation Detail dialog box. Review the details on the General tab. Click the Details tab, to see notes or comments about the proposed recommendation.

</Accordion>
2. You can group the system's recommendations by selecting an option from the Grouping dropdown. The displayed recommendations are grouped by the selected criteria. Select Analysis and observe the results. Re-select By Time (default). Click <InlineImage src="images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Analysis_Console_Getting_Started_Guide/03000007.png"/> to refresh the displayed list. Click Close to close this window and return to the Spectrum Detail pane.

## Types of Recommendations

In general there are three types of recommendations for VMs. These recommendations are applied in the following order:

* VM moves/placements rebalance workloads across hosts to optimizes fit on each host device. This action must be performed first.
* VM allocation (CPU, memory, disk space) increase can be performed after optimizing available space, to utilize any additional capacity.
* VM allocation (CPU, memory, disk space) decrease frees up capacity and can be done at anytime.

The following table lists the possible types of recommendations that you may encounter depending on the systems shown within the Spectrum (i.e. a host (H), VM (V), or sensor (S)).

## Reviewing Future Recommendations

You can also see recommendations for the predictive views into the future for the selected environment. The purpose of these recommendations is to show what adjustments may be required, provided the changes in the environment occur as predicted based on current placements, which may change in any of these future timeframes.

1. Select your environment in the Environment Navigator.
2. Move the Timeline slider to the right and stop on any available date in the future.
<Accordion title="Figure: Timeline Slider">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_DCI-Control_Guide/03000012_572x92.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>
3. The columns displayed in the Recommendations for \<Selected Day> tab for a future date are the same as those displayed for today. Also, the right-click options are the same as for the current day.

## Recommendations Override Feature

Densify provides the ability to specify a value for CPU/Memory or Disk recommendation indefinitely or until a given date. This is typically used to freeze a Densify recommendation for a specific VM until it goes through a company-specific approval process, which could potentially be more than one day.

This feature is primarily intended for automated integration with ticketing systems and ensures a consistent recommendation is generated every day though the approval cycle and also for implementing pre-scheduled allocation changes via the Densify action automation system.

Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) to configure this feature.
