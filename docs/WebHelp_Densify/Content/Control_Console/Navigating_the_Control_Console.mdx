The Control Console allows you to view your infrastructure, with ongoing placement and allocation analyses.

## Control Console Landing Page

When the Control Console opens you will be on the home page. This page provides the high-level view of all environments being managed through the Control Console.

<Accordion title="Figure: Control Console Home Page">

</Accordion>


In this view, you can see a summary of all your environments having either Too Little Infrastructure, Just Right or Too Much Infrastructure, according to policy. Each environment is shown with its name and Compute Efficiency Index (<Tooltip tip="Compute Efficiency Index. Calculation that measures the efficiency of your environment by evaluating the infrastructure that you have compared to the amount of infrastructure that you need. CEI reflects the amount of infrastructure required for both workload and policies given business, technical and resource constraints in your environment.">CEI</Tooltip>). Ideally, the CEIÂ value should be between 0.75 and 1.00, to be in the Just Right (green) area. See [Control Console Spectrum Overview](./Control_Console_Spectrum_Overview) for more details on these three sections.

If you hover over an environment, the following information is displayed as a popup tooltip showing the total number of Clusters, Hosts, VMs and \<sensor types> as applicable (both online and offline).

You can move the timeline slider to see how the infrastructure changes, with predictive analysis and planned incoming and outgoing supply and demand. See [Timeline Slider](./Timeline_Slider) for more details.
