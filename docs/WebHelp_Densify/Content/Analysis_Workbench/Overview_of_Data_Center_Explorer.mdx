The Data Center Explorer allows you to build dynamic models of virtual and physical infrastructure. It allows you to dynamically browse IT environments, and entire data centers, in order to locate servers and server groups on which you would like perform an analysis.

You need to have advanced permissions to access these pages.

Data Center Explorer is based on the last set of collected data and allows you to examine environments based on locations, environments, manufacturers, virtual infrastructure groups, and other technical and business attributes. This allows you to make sense of complex environments by leveraging disparate information, typically coming from several external sources in a single view.

Analysis templates, provided in the standard packages or templates that you have created can be applied to these groupings of systems, to deliver workload placement guidance and to continually assess the impact of change within virtualized infrastructures.

To access this functionality, click the Analysis Workbench tray and click Data Center Explorer. This will display the Data Center Explorer screen.

### Copy to Clipboard

From DCE, most functions within each tab support the copy to clipboard function, as shown below.

This icon allows you to copy the displayed information to the clipboard, so that it can then be pasted into an email or third-party application (such as MicrosoftÂ® Word). The copied information is exactly as displayed, including both text and graphics, but excluding user interface functionality that is not supported in the copy (e.g. hyperlink functionality, checkboxes for system selection).

The copy function can be extremely useful especially for capturing Workload Summary and Workload Viewer data.

In order to determine when the copy is done, the icon turns yellow (<InlineImage src="/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Intelligence_Workbench_Guide/08000035_10x12.png"/>) when the copy is selected and turns back to blue (<InlineImage src="/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Intelligence_Workbench_Guide/08000034_10x12.png"/>) when it is done. This may only be noticeable if the copy to clipboard takes a few seconds.
