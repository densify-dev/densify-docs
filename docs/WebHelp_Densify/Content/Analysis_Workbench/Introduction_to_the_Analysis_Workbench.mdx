The purpose of this topic is to describe how to view and manage the Densify view of your data center and to define the scope of both transform and Control Console scenarios.

The information provided here covers the features listed in the Analysis Workbench tray in the Analysis Console.

Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) if you require more information on using the advanced features such as creating and editing analyses and rulesets.

<Note>
The icon in the Analysis Console that opened the Densify Console has been removed. You can no longer use the same session to go from Analysis Console through to the Densify Console.

See [Browser Requirements](../Densify_Com/Browser_Requirements) for certified/supported browsers for the Analysis Console and the Densify Console.
