Dashboards provide you with a quick and intuitive way to view folder level and system level information. Initial dashboard views display an overview of the selected folder/system. Using the toolbar, you can look at other aspects of the selected folder/system, such as the installed software or the attributes associated with it, etc.

You can also drill-down to a greater level of detail for the selected folder/system, by clicking hyperlink items, such as system counts.

There are two dashboard viewers associated with Data Center Explorer.

* System Folder Level--This viewer provides both a graphical and tabular summary of the systems contained in the selected folder.

* System Level--This viewer provides a tabular summary of the selected system.

### System Folder Level Dashboard Viewer

The system folder level dashboard view displays information about all systems contained within the selected folder.

1. In the Analysis Console, navigate to the Analysis Workbench tray > Data Center Explorer.
2. Select a folder in the System Explorer tree view. The system folder dashboard viewer is displayed.

The viewer includes a toolbar for navigating the dashboard, a summary-level pie chart of the systems within the selected folder, and a table from which you can drill-down to access more detailed system information.

### System Level Dashboard Viewer

The system level dashboard displays information about a selected system. The tabs are similar to those described for the system folder and contain the same toolbar options.

At this level, you are focusing on specific a system as opposed to groupings of systems.

</Accordion>


The initial dashboard view at the system level displays a summary of configuration information for the selected system. Click the expand button <InlineImage src="/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/CiRBA_Intelligence_Workbench_Guide/0300001D.png"/> associated with a category type (e.g. VMware) to view its information, if that category is collapsed.

### Dashboard Tabs

Once the folder or system is selected, the following tabs are displayed in the dashboard pane.
