### DCE Views

Together with the filter feature (see [DCE Filters](./DCE_Filters)), views allow you to create a dynamic grouping of systems, based on system attributes, so that you can quickly locate the systems on which you wish to perform an audit or analysis.

Manually searching for systems maybe useful for locating disparate systems to include in an audit or analysis.

Views are based on system attributes and are the means by which systems can be found and separated from other systems. Of course, it is essential that your systems are tagged with the appropriate attributes for them to be captured.

There are three types of views: Virtual Environments, Public Views, and Private Views.

* Virtual Environments--includes views of virtual environments specific to VMware and IBM PowerVM.
* Public/Private views--These views are available to all operators (public). Private views are custom views that you have created for your use only (private).

<Note>
By default, several views are shipped with the product, based on common attributes, such as memory, processor speed, etc.
