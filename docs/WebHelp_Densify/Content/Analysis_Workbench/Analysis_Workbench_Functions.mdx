## Analysis Workbench Functions

This topic is focused on some of the features in the Analysis Workbench tray. It describes how to model your data center environment into logical groupings of systems on which you can then configure, perform and manage your analyses.

To access the above views, select the Analysis Workbench tray and then click the option to open the tree view or listing. i.e. Analysis Workbench > Control Environments.

The table below provides a description for each of the Analysis Workbench menu items. All user roles do not have full access to the features listed below. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details of your user role and allowed Analysis Workbench access.
