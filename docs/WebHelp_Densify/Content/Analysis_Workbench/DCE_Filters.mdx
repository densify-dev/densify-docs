### DCE Filters

Together with the view feature (see [DCE Views](./DCE_Views)), filters allow you to create a dynamic grouping of systems, based on system attributes, so that you can quickly locate the systems on which you wish to perform an audit or analysis.

With a view of your systems defined, you can apply optional filters. Filters allow you to further categorize systems within the selected view. For example, if you are viewing by Virtual Environment" and have hundreds of systems in this view, then rather than view all systems to find the systems that you want, you can simply apply a filter, which will limit the number of systems returned, to only those that you want.

If you selected view "Virtual Environment", you may want to view only those systems that are associated with a specific type of environment. You can do this by applying the appropriate filter (e.g. "AWS - RDS"). The view will be updated to display only those AWS-RDS systems in your Virtual Environment. Densify provides a list of default filters you can use.

Filters can also be used to locate and isolate data collection exceptions at a data center (or a technology domain) level without the need to check multiple individual audits.

You can use DCE filters for reporting.

You can also filter on system attributes to create more useful views and filters.

You cannot edit a filter once it is has been used to define a Control Console environment. A warning message appears indicating why your edits have been blocked. In this case, you can create another custom filter with a different name.
