#### DCE Workload Charts

The content and options on the workload charts are based on your:

* Selection in the DCE (system or folder);
* Toolbar button selection,
* Selected workload type.

See [DCE Workload Viewer](./DCE_Workload_Viewer) for details on navigating to this chart.

1. The workload chart is displayed for the selected workload. You can view another workload by selecting it from the dropdown.
2. You can hover over the columns in the chart to see quartile information about that column.
3. If you see the <InlineImage src="/Images/CiRBA_Intelligence_Workbench_Guide/03000029_12x15.png"/> icon as you hover over a column, you can drill-down on that column to reveal more information about it. For example, assume that you have created a chart, based on the last 12 months of data. You can see detailed information about a particular month by clicking the corresponding column. The chart opens accordingly.

You can drill-down until you reach the lowest level. For example, from a chart displaying the last 12 months of data, you can drill-down to the month and then to the day. This would represent the lowest level, as you cannot, in this instance, drill-down on the hours within that day.

4. When you are viewing this chart at the DCEÂ folder level you can see the number or workload days missing from the selected scope of systems as indicated with the asterisk (\*). This is not displayed at the system level.
5. A table is displayed below the quartile data.
