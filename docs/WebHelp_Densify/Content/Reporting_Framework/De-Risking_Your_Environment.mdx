The Risk reports provide an overview of the over-utilized clusters and systems within your on-premise environments. These reports answer the questions about how to identify and reduce over-utilization risk in your environments by implementing Densify's rebalancing and bump-up recommendations. These reports help you to determine the following:

* Have you correctly allocated resources to your guests?
* Can you re-balance workloads over the available hosts to reduce over-utilization risk?
* Should you add more hosts?
* Are your policy settings correct for the selected environment?

<p>Clusters with Insufficient Capacity <a name="kanchor69"></a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This report shows which clusters are at risk in the environment due to insufficient infrastructure to support the current workloads. </p>
<p>The report provides the primary resource constraint for each of the clusters. Based on this information, you can then reduce risk by adding resources, moving workloads, or when appropriate, modifying the policy.</p>
<p>The 90-day historical report provides a view of clusters at risk over time. </p>

<p>Hosts at Risk<a name="kanchor70"></a></p>
</td>

<p>This report shows the number of host servers at risk in the environment due to having too many workload placements. </p>
<p>The report provides rebalancing recommendations that can be performed to reduce the number of host servers at risk. </p>
