title: "Forecasting"

The Forecast report provides an overview of your on-premise environments (as defined by your global filter) with the available capacity and primary constraint information for all future timeframes. With the primary constraint information, potential limits on availability can be identified and addressed before issues arise.

The report uses live data, meaning that as you plan new demand and supply, the available capacity is updated immediately, without requiring an analysis refresh.

See [Using the Global Filter](../Densify_Com/Using_the_Global_Filter) for details on defining your scope.

## Calculation of Available Capacity

The Forecast report calculates the available capacity as follows:

* Today--uses existing placements and allocations, with no recommendations applied
* All other timeframes--assumes both placement and allocation increases/decreases are made

The available capacity also takes into account projected growth and new demand and supply.
