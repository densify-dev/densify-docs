The Optimization Policies tab provides a summary of the policy settings applied to your cloud environments. You cannot edit policy settings from this tab. Contact Support@Densify.com for more information on customizing your policy settings.

## Virtual Optimization Policies

This page provides a summary of the policies in use by your on-premise virtual environments.

Additionally you can review the number of hosts, number of guests, whether or not the cluster is closed for new bookings, its primary constraint, etc.

### Filtering Policy Categories

The scope of clusters is defined by the global filter. See [Using the Global Filter](../Densify_Com/Using_the_Global_Filter.htm) for details.

You can also filter by the type of policy settings. Currently you can select from Supply Optimization or Datastore settings.

The 10 standard policy settings and any non-standard policy settings that have been modified are listed.
