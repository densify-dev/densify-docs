Systems exempted by a user are not shown in the Opportunity reports. See [Granting Exemptions](../Control_Console/Managing_Notifications_and_Exemptions#Granting_Exemptions) for details of exempting systems.

The Opportunity reports provide an overview of under-utilized infrastructure and oversized guests within your on-premise environments. These reports answer the question of whether or not you can find more capacity in your environments by implementing Densify's bump-down recommendations. These reports help you determine the following:

* Have you correctly allocated resources to your guests?
* Can you re-balance workloads over the available hosts to make room for additional incoming workloads?
* Are your policy settings correct for the selected environment?

<td>
<p>This report shows the VM/host stacking ratios (for current and optimized), VM density increase opportunities, the number of physical servers required and whether there is a surplus or shortfall.</p>

<p><a name="kanchor24"></a>Clusters with Surplus Capacity</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This report shows excess infrastructure. </p>
<p>The report shows the best clusters to route new workloads. The value is based on what infrastructure can host the most new workloads according to the operational policy.</p>
<p>The 90-day historical report provides a view of the infrastructure's densification opportunity over time.</p>

<p>This report shows the number of guests that have excess resources allocated.</p>
<p>The report provides memory, CPU and aggregate disk bump-down recommendations to reclaim resources from oversized guests and free up resources so that more guests can be accommodated on the same infrastructure. </p>

<p>This report shows how well the cluster's hardware resources match the workload demand running on that cluster. A high mismatch rating means that you need to investigate and possibly modify the cluster’s hardware allocation or move different workloads  to this cluster. </p>
