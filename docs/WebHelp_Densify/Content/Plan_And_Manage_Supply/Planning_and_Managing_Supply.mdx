The Plan and Manage Supply page allows you to plan new hosts and datastores, to your destination internal VMware hosting venues.

With new supply, Densify increases the available capacity allowing you to forecast and plan new workloads based on the extra capacity of the planned supply.

## Target Audience

The Plan and Manage Supply page is intended for users who plan new hosts and datastores as part of their role. To plan for the removal of existing supply from your environment, contact your Cloud Advisor.

To route and reserve new workloads, use the Route and Reserve Demand page (see [Routing and Reserving Demand](../Route_And_Reserve_Demand/Routing_and_Reserving_Demand)).
