title: "Defining New Hosts"
---

New hosts can be planned and managed through the Plan Hosts screen. Through this screen, you can add new hosts, e.g. for a new project that is starting in a few months or for an over-provisioned environment. Once new hosts are added, the capacity for that hosting venue is available immediately for new workloads, starting at the Planned Date when the host is planned to be provisioned. New hosts are automatically connected to all datastores available to the environment. Results are visible through:

* Route and Reserve Demand page--so that you can define and route new workloads with that new capacity after the Planned Date (see [Defining Demand](../Route_And_Reserve_Demand/Defining_Demand)).
* By the Numbers dashboard--you can view the new capacity after the Planned Date. See[Understanding the By the Numbers Report](../Reporting_Framework/Understanding_the_By_the_Numbers_Report)).
* Forecast Report--so that you can view the new capacity details after the Planned Date (see [Forecasting](../Reporting_Framework/Forecasting)).

## Adding New Planned Hosts

When creating a new host, a set amount of mandatory information needs to be entered including the expected system name, the target hosting venue, the planned date and model/sizing information. Once a host has been added, only the system name can be updated.

To begin defining your planned hosts, navigate to the Plan and Manage Supply page to the Plan Hosts screen. Click Add. The Add Host Supply dialog box is displayed. Define your hosts, section by section as described below. After you click on Save, the new planned hosts are added to the displayed list (with booking type "Add"). At this point, you can only edit the System Name.

<p>The date the host is expected to be running and available for placing VMs. This date is based on the <span class="mc-variable Document.Company variable">Densify</span> server’s time zone, which is shown with a GMT offset, e.g. "(UTC -4:00)". The calendar picker shows the date based on the <span class="mc-variable Document.Company variable">Densify</span> server’s time zone. The earliest date is tomorrow's date, i.e. the host must be provisioned today ready for placing VMs tomorrow.</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>Copies</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Enter the number of copies, to create multiple copies of the same host. The System Name is appended by a counter, e.g. if System Name is "ucs-host" and you enter 3, then three host records are created as "ucs-host1", "ucs-host2" and "ucs-host3".</p>

<p>Operational Environment</p>
</td>

<p>Select the operational environment for the host if applicable. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Step 6: Confirming the Host Placement

You can see these new host bookings when you move the timeline after the date when the corresponding hosts are planned to come online. An analytics refresh is first required to incorporate the bookings into the environment. See [Bookings and the Timeline](../Control_Console/Timeline_Slider#Bookings) for details.

These new host bookings are now available to host new workloads having later planned start dates. See [Defining Demand](../Route_And_Reserve_Demand/Defining_Demand) for details on planning new workloads.

## Listing Planned Hosts

The Plan Hosts of the Plan and Manage Supply page provides a list of planned hosts. If the host is not provisioned by the planned date, the planned host expires and is removed from the list.

The Plan Hosts list is filtered according to the global filter. See [Using the Global Filter](../Densify_Com/Using_the_Global_Filter).

## Changing the System Name

Often the name of the planned host changes and you need to edit it, so that the incoming host can be reconciled during the analysis refresh.

You can select and Edit one host at a time, to change its expected name. The update is reflected in the displayed list of hosts.

No other fields are editable.

## Canceling Planned Hosts

If you need to cancel any of the new planned hosts, e.g. the project is downsized or canceled, you can select multiple hosts in the list and click on Delete. The available capacity is immediately adjusted and the hosts are removed from the displayed list.

## Copying a New Planned Host

You can copy an existing planned host, by selecting it in the list and clicking on Copy. Change fields as needed. The new hosts are added to the displayed list.
