<Accordion title="Cause: There is an issue with the Densify Connector service">
This typically indicates that the Densify Connector service is not running or is in an unhealthy state.

Solution: Restart the connector service to cycle the application using the following steps:

1. On the server where the Densify Connector is installed, open the Window’s Start Menu and type "services.msc" to open the Services management window.
2. Locate and select the service, Densify Connector.
3. Right-click the service. Click Properties and confirm that the Startup type is set to “Automatic”.

* If the service is running, then click Restart.
* If the service is not running, click Start.

For detailed prerequisites and configuration details, see [Connector Prerequisites](../Densify_Com/Connector_Prerequisites).

If the service still does not start, then do the following:

1. Create a zipped archive of the following folder: `C:/Program Files/Densify Connector/logs`.

If you installed the connector in a location other than the default, then create a zipped archive of the logs folder in the location where you installed the Densify Connector

2. Once created, send the file to [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) to review the details, and receive further guidance.
3. If you have recently removed this vCenter from your Densify Connector, please let the Densify Support Team know so that the corresponding Control Environment can be removed.
