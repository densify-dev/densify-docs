### Event: Partial or No Workload Data

Common reasons for collection of only partial vCenter data:

<Accordion title="Cause: When collecting workload with vROps , vCenter data is collected but vROps is not">
Solution: This may be due to invalid vROps credentials. Confirm your username and password are valid.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cause: Time at which the audit is running.">
For example, if vCenter data retention is set to 1-day, the audit must run at 00:05 (12:05 am) to collect the last 24 hours.

Solution: Verify the audit time has not been affected by a change due to Daylights Saving Time.

Solution: Configure vCenter data retention to store 2 days of data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cause: Audit timeout occurred during collection from the vCenter Server .">
Solution: Do the following steps to investigate the vCenter connection:

1. Open the Densify Connector.
2. Select the audit.
3. Click the button Click to Verify vCenter Connection.

* If the connection is OK, then click Save Connection and Collect Data Now to collect the data.
* If an error is returned from the verification step, then investigate the issue on the vCenter.

4. Alternatively, try connecting to the vCenter from the host running the Densify Connector to verify connectivity to the vCenter outside of your Densify instance.
</Accordion>
