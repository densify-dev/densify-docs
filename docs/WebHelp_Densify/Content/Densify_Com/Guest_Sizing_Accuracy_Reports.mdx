The Guest Sizing Accuracy reports show how accurately guests are sized on their current host. The reports use CPU, memory and disk metrics to perform the analysis. These reports include guests running on virtual machines.

## Private Cloud > Optimization Overview

You can access the detailed reports through the private cloud page as follows: Private Cloud > Optimization Overview  > Guest Sizing Accuracy report.

The pie chart shows private cloud virtual guests (VMs) that are either at risk, oversized, both undersized and oversized (i.e. undersized for one resource and oversized for another) and sized correctly. Bookings are not included in the Guest Sizing Accuracy reports.

Click zoom <InlineImage src="/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_Reporting_Framework/03000040_20x19.png"/> to see the Guest Sizing Accuracy dashboard. You can update the filter settings at any time to adjust the scope of the reports. For example, if you want to review only guests for a specific location, click Set Filter and select the specific infrastructure location you are interested in. Four tabs provide additional details.

### Summary

This report shows guest sizing data by cluster, in a graphical format. Footnotes at the bottom of the charts provide significant information to help you understand the report content.

The pie chart shows breakdown for all guests included in the scope of the report and the bar charts show the guests sizing accuracy breakdown by both total number and percentage of guests per cluster. Environment and the cluster are used to identify guest containment on the bar charts.

You can hover over any of the bars in the chart to see details. The bars are color-coded to indicated guest that are undersized (red), oversized (yellow), both undersized and oversized (orange), and correctly sized (green). A footnote also indicates the number of guests that are considered both undersized and oversized, if applicable.

### Allocation Breakdown

This reports shows the guest resource allocation breakdown in a graphical format. Bar charts show the allocation surplus/shortfall by CPU, memory and aggregate disk, by cluster. You can hover over any of the bars in the chart to see details. The bars are color-coded to indicate the undersized (red) and oversized (yellow) amounts.

Summary tiles provide overall CPU, memory and aggregate disk surplus/shortfall.

### Cluster Details

This report summarizes the number of undersized, just right and oversized guests, in tabular format, by cluster.

### System Details

Provides the CPU, memory and aggregate disk breakdown, by guest. The Overall Status accounts for per disk policy violations and may differ from that on the Control Console Spectrum which accounts for aggregate disk policy violations.

Highlighted values recommend resource increases or decreases and are color-coded for easy review.

Systems that are not analyzed are included in the "Just Right" counts across all Guest Sizing Accuracy reports. The reason that the system was not analyzed is shown in the "Recommendation Reason/Observations" column, if available.

<Note>
If one or more resource utilization metrics are not available, the missing value is indicated as a dash.

#### Resource Utilization Metrics: Low/High Limits

The Resource Utilization Metrics: Low Limits tab displays utilization charts with the lower limits of the policy, exposing over-allocated resources. Utilization charts for CPU, disk, and memory are shown for current and recommended resource allocations.

The Resource Utilization Metrics: High Limits tab displays utilization charts with the higher limits of the policy, exposing under-allocated resources. Utilization charts for CPU, disk, and memory are shown for current and recommended resource allocations.

Use the left/right arrows to scroll though the various workload charts. If no data has been collected or is not available, the corresponding chart is not displayed.

Workload charts display current sustained activity in blue, while sustained activity on the recommended instance type chart is shown in green. The minimum and maximum utilization values are shown as vertical lines above and below the coloured block. The median is indicated as a black line within the coloured block. The average is indicated in brackets, in the sub-title of the chart. The scale used on the Y-axis is scaled dynamically to match the range of data. The pink line indicating the high policy limit setting is shown, and the setting of the Y-axis scale also accounts for this value. The yellow line indicates the policy low limit. If the high and low are the same, the dashed yellow/pink line indicates the value.
