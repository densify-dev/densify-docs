title: "Understanding the Instance Optimization Details Report"
---

The Instance Optimization Details report displays instance-specific details for the instance type group selected from an optimization opportunity or Public Cloud Overview report.

Open the Instance Optimization Details report, by clicking on a hyperlinked value in the Count column from a supported optimization opportunity tabular report.

The Instance Optimization Details report for ASGs is covered in [Working with Auto Scaling Groups](./Working_with_ASGs).

<Note>
Cloud instances that do not have adequate information for recommendation analysis are not included in the Instance Optimization Details report. For example, this would include guests with no or incomplete benchmark data.

The Instance Optimization Details dashboard consists of:

* A tabular report—The columns of the tabular report change depending on the selected instance type. Refer to the [Table: Instance Optimization Details Tabular Report Columns](#Instance_Optimization_Details_Component) below for details. See [Data Controls](#Data), below to search, sort, export and customize the table's content.
* A lower pane with system details—Based on the selected system in the tabular top pane, various details and settings for the system are available in separate tabs, such as system resource utilization charts, system details, optimization approvals and modifying system attributes. See [Reviewing Specific Instance Details](#Lower_Section) for details on each tab.

## Reviewing the Instance Optimization Details Table

### Summary Bar

A summary bar showing the number of services and potentials savings is displayed at the top of the page. These values relate only to the content of the details page and not your total environment.

### Data Controls

The controls, in the upper right corner of the page, provide options for managing and viewing your data more effectively. See [Data Controls on Tabular Reports](./Navigating_Densify#Data_Controls) for more details.

### Tabular Report

The columns of the tabular report change depending on the selected instance type. Refer to the table below for details. See [Data Controls](#Data), above to search, sort, export and customize the table's content.

The following descriptions and color coding apply to all AWS, Azure and GCP tabs.

<Note>
Not all optimization types are supported for all cloud providers.

### Reviewing Specific Instance Details

Clicking on any row in the tabular report shows more detailed system information for that instance, in the 4 tabs, on the lower pane:

* Resource Utilization Metrics: Cloud Tab—The charts on this tab show the utilization for various workloads for the selected instance.
<Note>
If no metrics are available, then the corresponding chart is not displayed.
</Note>



If a cloud instance has been optimized (i.e. instance type has been changed based on a recommendation), then on the next day you will see the Optimization Type set to "Just Right" and since the required data (as defined by the policy) has not been accumulated, only the Memory BackFill workload chart is displayed, if enabled. See the column, [Instance Type Updated On](#Inst_Updated) , above for more details.

These workload charts show hourly min/max and sustained activity for the selected system. Use the left/right arrows to scroll though the various workload charts.

Workload charts show current Sustained Activity in blue, while Sustained Activity on the recommended instance type is shown in green.

<Note>
When reviewing Optimal and Terminate recommendations the recommended instance type (green) is not applicable and so is not shown.
</Note>



The minimum and maximum utilization values are shown as vertical lines above and below the coloured block. The median is indicated as a black line within the coloured block. The average is indicated in brackets, in the sub-title of the chart.

The scale used on the Y-axis is scaled dynamically to match the range of data. Where applicable, the pink line indicating the policy high limit, is shown, and the setting of the Y-axis scale also accounts for the policy limit setting.

* System Information Tab—Click on this tab to see allocated resources and some of the organizational attributes that have been set for this guest.
* Effort Details Tab—This tab lists the factors that contribute to the effort required to investigate and implement the Densify recommendations. Effort for each instance is calculated by rule-driven analytics based on factors (such as instance family change, storage change, data quality checks, feature changes, etc.) that can be configured in the policy settings and through analysis rule sets. A description of each rule/property and its impact on the effort to move the current instance to the recommended instance type are provided.

Contact Support@Densify.com for further details on the policy settings and rule set configured for your environment.

* Predicted Uptime Details Tab—This tab shows a pie chart with the uptime details for the selected instance.

#### Quartiles in the Resource Utilization Charts

<Accordion title="">

</Accordion>

In charts, workload data for each system is shown in four different bars (two yellow and two red), called quartiles, to show minimum, average, sustained and peak values. When used in the analysis, quartiles provide a good representation of system activity because the weighted scoring for sustained and peak activity produces a more accurate assessment of workload utilization patterns and requirements.

Quartiles are calculated in the following manner:

* Workload activity is collected every five minutes, which totals 12 times per hour.
* The 12 values are then re-ordered in descending order and separated into equal sample sizes (quartiles), with each quartile having three values. Each quartile represents 25% of operational time.
* The bottom of the first quartile shows the minimum value, the next quartile shows average values, the top of the third quartile shows the sustained value and the top of the fourth quartile shows the peak value.

### Editing System Attributes

The Edit System Attributes tab in the lower pane of the Instance Optimization Details report allows you to edit specific attributes of the system selected from the top pane.

This feature is supported via the Densify API.

<Accordion title="Figure: Edit System Attributes Tab">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/06000031.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>

The following default system attribute categories are available for editing:

* Business
* Routing

Contact Support@Densify.com if you require additional system attributes to be exposed for editing.

Attribute changes are displayed accordingly in the Edit Systems Attributes tab.

Densify optimization and reporting database updates are required before the saved values are reflected in the Instance Optimization Details tabular report and footer. For example, if you update and save one of the Self-Optimizing Automation Overrides attributes, you can see the updated value in the Edit Systems Attributes tab and extract the updated attribute value from the Densify API. However, the Instance Optimization Details tabular report and footer will not display the recommendation results of the updated value until analysis has been performed and the reporting tables have been updated via the overnight scheduled job.
