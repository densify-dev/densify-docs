<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
<p>Filter</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Description</p>
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Scale Based on CPU Benchmarks</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The target system is selected based on the CPU benchmark value of the source system. </p>
<p>For example if the source system is 2 CPU x 4 MB with a benchmark value of 60, then a target system that matches the benchmark value of 60 will be used regardless of whether it has the same hardware configuration. A system with 1 CPU x 4 MB, but with a faster CPU that has a benchmark value of 60 would be a viable transfer option.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Optimally Densify based on Utilization</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The target system is based on optimal system size, based on the  current utilization.</p>
<p>For example, if the current system is a 4 CPU x 12 MB, but the deployed application is only using a fraction of these allocated resources, then the <span class="mc-variable Document.Company variable">Densify</span> determines the optimal allocation and selects the appropriate target system.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Maintain Existing Allocation</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The selected target system is the same size as the source.</p>
