title: "Understanding the Automation Insight Report"
---

The Automation Insight dashboard provides real-time and proactive automation reports that help you monitor which clusters have enabled real-time and proactive automation, the number of executed actions, and a real-time/historical view of completed actions throughout the day. This page is divided into two sections: Real-time Automation and Proactive Automation.

<Note>
Both types of automation insight are only supported for VMware environments.

## Real-Time Automation

The Real-time Automation reports provide a comprehensive view of clusters in your environment that have real-time automation enabled, current actions that are being executed, and a historical/real-time view of completed actions. Currently, CPU andÂ Memory Bump Ups are executed under Real-time Automation.

With Real-time Automation, actions are executed automatically when alarms are detected due to resource constraints. The Real-time Automation section is comprised of three reports:

* Real-Time Automation Coverage--Shows the percentage of clusters with Real-time Automation enabled by resource type.
* Real-Time Actions--Shows the number of completed actions by resource type.
* History of Real-Time Actions--Shows a historical/real- time view of actions completed by resource type.

For more information, see [Using Real-Time Automation](./Using_Real-Time_Automation).

## Proactive Automation

The Proactive Automation reports provide a comprehensive view of clusters in your environment that have proactive automation enabled, current proactive actions that are scheduled to be completed, and a historical view of when proactive actions have been executed. Currently bump ups (CPU, Memory, Disk), bump downs (CPU, Memory) , and rebalancing moves are executed under Proactive Automation.

With Proactive Automation, actions are reviewed and executed on a schedule. The Proactive Automation section is comprised of three reports:

* Proactive Automation Coverage--Shows the percentage of clusters with Proactive Automation enabled by resource type.
* Proactive Actions--Shows the number of completed, proactive actions by resource type.
* History of Proactive Actions--Shows a historical view of proactive and scheduled actions that have been completed by resource type.

For more information, see [Using Proactive Automation](./Using_Proactive_Automation).
