## Private Cloud

For VMware you install a data connector, set a connection schedule and Densify takes care of the rest. You can log into a secure, dedicated SaaS instance to access the optimization and risk reduction reports with details on how to increase density and gain stability in your environment.

See [Connector Prerequisites](./Connector_Prerequisites) for details on getting started immediately.
