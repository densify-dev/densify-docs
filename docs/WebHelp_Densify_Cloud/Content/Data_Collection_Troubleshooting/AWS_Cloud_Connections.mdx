### Event: Account does not exist or incorrect permissions

The following are common issues when working with AWS cloud connections:

<Accordion title="Cause: AWS Account no longer exists">
Solution: If the account no longer exists, the connection can be deleted using the Public Cloud Connection Wizard. See [Deleting a Connection](../Densify_Com/Using_the_Public_Cloud_Connection_Wizard.htm#Deleting).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cause: Account exists, but has incorrect permissions">
Solution: Ensure the [Minimum Permissions for CloudWatch Data Collection](../Data_Collection_for_Public_Cloud_Systems/AWS_Data_Collection_Prerequisites_for_an_IAM_Role__CloudWatch_only_.htm#Limited_Access_IAM_Policy) are set correctly.

Once the permissions have been corrected, you can verify the connection using the Public Cloud Connection Wizard. See [Reviewing a Connection](../Densify_Com/Using_the_Public_Cloud_Connection_Wizard.htm#Review_Conn).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cause: Account exists, but is configured incorrectly">
Solution:Ensure the [AWS Data Collection Prerequisites for an IAM Role](../Data_Collection_for_Public_Cloud_Systems/AWS_Data_Collection_Prerequisites_for_an_IAM_Role__CloudWatch_only_.htm) are setup correctly, Including that the External ID you have entered corresponds to the correct IAMÂ Role.

Once the prerequisites and credentials have been corrected, you can verify the connection using the Public Cloud Connection Wizard. See [Reviewing a Connection](../Densify_Com/Using_the_Public_Cloud_Connection_Wizard.htm#Review_Conn).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cause: Systems within the AWS account are not supported">
Solution: If your account only contains services that Densify does not analyze, then the audit will fail. i.e. DynamoDB, Redshift, Lambda, ElasticCache, etc.

Within Densify you need to manually delete the Cloud Environments associated with these accounts.
</Accordion>
