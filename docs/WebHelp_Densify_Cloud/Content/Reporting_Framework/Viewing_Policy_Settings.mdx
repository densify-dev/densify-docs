### Filtering Policy Categories

You can filter the settings to review, using the Select drop down menu at the top of the page. You can review a specific policy category or all categories, using the options in this menu. The policy settings displayed in the top pane as well as the Settings Descriptions tab, in the bottom pane, are defined by this filter.

<Note>
Advanced policy categories are not displayed in this filter.
</Note>



### Using the Lower Pane

The top pane displays the active policies and their setting values. The lower pane displays policy settings for the policy or category selected in the top pane:

* Description--The description of the cloud policy, selected in the top pane.
* Accounts/Subscriptions/Projects--The accounts, subscriptions, or projects associated with the selected cloud policy. The Densify analytics use the policy to generate recommendation for the listed accounts, subscriptions, or projects.
* Settings Descriptions--Descriptions of the standard policy settings, including the parent category and the default values.

### Exporting Cloud Optimization Policies

You can export your cloud policy settings for external review. See [Exporting Report Data](../Densify_Com/Exporting_Report_Data) for details on using the Export to Excel feature.

* Description--Displays the descriptions of each cloud policy.
* Accounts/Subscriptions/Projects--This tab displays all of the accounts, subscriptions, or projects that are using one of the policies.
* Settings Descriptions--Displays all policy settings, their parent category, setting description and default value.
