## What is a Policy

Policies are settings that bring together and formalize the unique requirements and management criteria of an environment including constraints, regulations and operational goals. Densify uses these settings as a basis for recommendations and to measure and show efficiency and risk.

Control policies are used with the analysis models to generate the analyses required to populate overview dashboards and charts in the Densify Console. When the environment is created the policy is specified based on your use case. You can then work with [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) to customize the policy to better suit your requirements.

Densify control policies allow you to tailor the Densify analytics engine to accurately maximize efficiency and minimize risk. Policies represent the unique requirements, constraints and operational goals of your virtual environments. Once captured, policies can be customized and re-used for each of your various environments.

Once selected and customized, your policy is used by the analyses to provide a true picture of infrastructure efficiency. Policies cover both quantitative criteria such as maximum and minimum utilization levels, contention tolerances, etc.; and qualitative criteria such as business rules, technical affinities/anti-affinities, security requirements, process requirements, etc.

## Mapping Your Requirements to Densify Policy Criteria

In order for Densify to generate recommendations to best reflect your environment goals and requirements, you need to map your environment requirements to policies in Densify. Before setting and changing any policy settings, you need an understanding of not only your virtual infrastructure, but also of business and operational guidelines that are unique to your company or line of business.

For example if your production environment requires HA infrastructure, this company policy needs to be represented in the Densify policy. In this case the corresponding policy criteria would be HA policy.

Each policy consists of a number of areas of infrastructure management considerations that impact the operation of cloud environments. When combined, these criteria and the resulting policy help to achieve the goals for your environment, whether it be to maximize efficiency (cost) or increase performance, or a balance between efficiency and performance.

## Policy Categories Overview

Each policy is organized into categories. Each category groups policy settings logically, based on how the settings are used to define your environment. These categories can be further grouped by functionality, though this additional grouping is not displayed in the dialog box.

## Commonly Tuned Policy Settings

Before onboarding your environments you will meet with account manager to review the your requirements and then select the policy and tune the settings to align with your requirements. The policy spreadsheets provide a method to review and track changes setting.

The following settings commonly tuned for cloud environments:

* Workload history--The number of days of data required for different types of recommendations. See
* Backfill Missing Memory--These policy settings allow you configure the way in which you account for missing memory data.
* Service type catalog --You can use custom instances for your recommendations. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details.
* Service pricing and discounting--You can specify custom pricing, that you have negotiated with your cloud vendor, for your recommendations. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details.
* CPU, Memory and I/O Utilization Limits--These policy setting allow you to define the up/down sizing and idle detection limits.
* Memory scoring strategy--Specify a scoring strategy for memory utilization, if you are using memory data.
* Recommendation locking and overriding--Control Instance Type Override behaviour using a combination of policy setting and attributes.

The following settings are commonly tuned for container environments:

* Workload history--The number of days of data needed for different types recommendations.
* CPU and Memory Utilization Limits--These policy settings define the up/down sizing and idle detection limits.
