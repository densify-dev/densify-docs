## Collecting Data from Your Public Cloud

You can collect and analyze data from your public cloud environments. You can configure a connection from Densify to your cloud-hosted environments through the [cloud connection wizard](../Densify_Com/Using_the_Public_Cloud_Connection_Wizard) or through the Densify API.

Review the connection prerequisites to configure a user account that can then be used to create a connection toÂ Densify:

* [AWS Data Collection Using a CloudFormation Template](./AWS_Data_Collection_Using_a_CloudFormation_Template). Densify recommends using the CloudFormation template as it automates the entire process.
* [AWS Data Collection Prerequisites for an IAM Role (CloudWatch only)](./AWS_Data_Collection_Prerequisites_for_an_IAM_Role__CloudWatch_only_).
* [Microsoft Azure Data Collection Prerequisites for a Service Principal](./Microsoft_Azure_Data_Collection_Prerequisites_for_a_Service_Principal)
* [Google Cloud Platform Data Collection Prerequisites](./Google_Cloud_Platform_Data_Collection_Prerequisites)

Once your data has been analyzed, you can see your results in [Optimizing Your Public Cloud](../Densify_Com/Optimizing_Your_Public_Cloud).

## Configuring Public Cloud Audits to use a Proxy Server

You can configure your public cloud connection to use a proxy server, for additional security. You need to provide the following information to [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com):

* Proxy server name
* Proxy server access port
* User Name and encrypted password, if authentication is required
