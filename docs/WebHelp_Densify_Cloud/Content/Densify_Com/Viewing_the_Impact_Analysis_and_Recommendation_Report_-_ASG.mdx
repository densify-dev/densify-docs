<Note>
This report is not available for Azure VM Scale Sets.
</Note>

As the application owner, you want to see more details of your particular cloud service, before implementing Densify's recommendations.
Specifically:

* Optimization Reasoning—The data and the policy settings that resulted in the recommendation being made.
* Verification—Ensure that the recommendation aligns with your financial and organizational goals.

To learn more watch the video:

You can access this report by clicking the Analysis Report hyperlink in the lower pane of the Instance Optimization Details page to open the Impact Analysis and Recommendation Report for the selected group. See [Working with Auto Scaling Groups](./Working_with_ASGs).

The Impact Analysis and Recommendation report provides the following details for a selected cloud service:

* Scale Group Name and the date of the last data collection.
* Report description;
* [Summary](#Summary) —Provides an overview of the ASG;
* [Scale Group Information](#ASGProperties)—Provides properties and configuration details for the selected cloud service;
* [Recommendation Details](#RecommendationDetails)—A number of sections that show workload charts and the impact of making the recommended changes;
* [Effort to Optimize Auto Scaling Group](#Effort)—Lists the factors that contribute to the effort required to investigate and implement the recommendation;
* [Cost Impact](#Cost)—Provides the cost benefits of implementing the recommendation.

You can scroll through the report or you can click on one of the Details tabs at the top of the page to jump to the relevant section within the report.

## Creating a PDF Version of the Report

You can create a PDF version of the report by clicking the Export to PDF <InlineImage src="/Images/Cirba_Reporting_Framework/03000053_14x14.png"/> button located at the top-right corner of the display.

The export file is named "SystemAnalysis.pdf" and is saved to the download folder defined by your browser. You may want to modify the filename to match the selected instance, if you are planning to review and distribute reports for multiple instances.

## Summary

### Summary Table

The summary table identifies the cloud service with any user defined tags, and provides an overview of any generated recommendations, predicted uptime, and policy used for the service.

### Optimization Benefits

This section of the summary lists the benefits that can be gained from implementing the recommendation. A list of bullet points maps the values of Overall Status and Optimization Types to the actual benefits to you, as the application owner, in terms of both cost and performance.

If the overall status for the selected instance is Optimal, then this section is not displayed.

If the percentage cost saving is \<0.1%, then the Savings benefit is not displayed.

### Predicted Scaling Activity and Utilization

This table provides a summary of impact to group size, instance type, CPU and memory utilization if you were to move your application to the recommended scale group configuration. The full version of this report is provided in the [Recommendation Details](#RecommendationDetails) section.

The Change column at the right, highlights differences between your current and the recommended scale group's utilization and scaling activity. This column is shown only if there are recommendations for the scale group.

<Accordion title="Figure: Predicted Scaling Activity and Utilization Section">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/06000214.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>

The workload charts in this section show in-service instances, CPU utilization, and memory utilization (%) for the current scale group and these same metrics as they would be on the recommended scale group configuration. Additionally, both CPU Reservation% and Memory Reservation% charts for current and recommended instances are shown if the data is available.

Auto Scaling groups that have been identified as "Just Right" or "Terminate" will not have any recommendations and only the current utilization data and charts are shown.

<Note>
If the metrics are not available, then the corresponding chart is not displayed.
</Note>



When actual memory data is not collected and memory workloads are backfilled as defined in the policy, a footnote will be added to indicate that memory utilization is based on user-defined policy settings.

## Recommendation Details

<Note>
Not all utilization metrics are available for all cloud services and providers. The metrics displayed in the following tables and charts will vary depending on the selected service type.
</Note>


### Predicted Scaling Activity and Utilization

This table provides the impact to group size, instance type , CPU and memory utilization, as well as network IO throughput if you were to move your application to the recommended scale group configuration. The last column highlights differences between your current and the recommended scale group's utilization and scaling activity. This column is shown only if there are recommendations for the scale group.

Auto Scaling group that have been identified as "Just Right" or "Terminate" will not have any recommendations and only the current utilization data and charts are shown.

### Resource Allocation (per Instance)

This table allows you to compare the allocated resources on the instance type, configured currently in your scale group launch configuration, to those allocated to the recommended instance type.

The column at the right end of the chart highlights differences between your current instance type and the recommended instance type allocations.

If there is no recommended instance type, the Recommended and Change columns are not displayed.

### Workload Charts

The following workload charts are provided so you can compare utilization on the current service against that of the recommended service configuration or instance type. The charts for the current service are shown on the left side and the charts for the recommended service are shown on the right side.

If utilization metrics are not available, the corresponding chart is not displayed.

Cloud services that are identified as "Just Right" or "Terminate" only have current utilization charts shown.

When actual memory data is not collected, and memory workloads are backfilled with the memory usage as defined by the policy, no recommended memory workload chart is displayed.

## Effort to Optimize Auto Scaling Group

The table in this section lists the factors that contribute to the effort required to investigate and implement the recommendations. Effort for the selected instance is calculated by rule-driven analytics based on various factors (such as instance family change, storage change, data quality checks, feature changes, group size changes etc.) that can be configured in the policy settings and through analysis rule sets.

A description of each rule and its impact on the effort to move the current service to the recommended service type or configuration is provided.

This is the same information that is reported on the Effort Details tab in the Instance Optimization Details dashboard. See [Understanding the Instance Optimization Details Report](./Understanding_the_Instance_Details_Report).

Contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for details on the policy settings and rule sets configured for your environment.

This table is not displayed for the following conditions:

* "Just Right" optimization type—no effort is required to remain at the current service;
* "Downscale" or "Upscale" optimization type with "None" effort—for Auto Scaling groups with only sizing recommendations, no instance changing effort is required.
