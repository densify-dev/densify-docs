title: "Understanding the Instance Optimization Details Report"
---

The Instance Optimization Details report displays instance-specific details for the instance type group selected from an optimization opportunity or Public Cloud Overview report.

Open the Instance Optimization Details report, by clicking on a hyperlinked value in the Count column from a supported optimization opportunity tabular report.

The Instance Optimization Details report for ASGs is covered in [Working with Auto Scaling Groups](./Working_with_ASGs).

<Note>
Cloud instances that do not have adequate information for recommendation analysis are not included in the Instance Optimization Details report. For example, this would include guests with no or incomplete benchmark data.

The Instance Optimization Details dashboard consists of:

* A tabular report--The columns of the tabular report change depending on the selected instance type. Refer to the [Table: Instance Optimization Details Tabular Report Columns](#Instance_Optimization_Details_Component) below for details. See [Data Controls](#Data), below to search, sort, export and customize the table's content.
* A lower pane with system details--Based on the selected system in the tabular top pane, various details and settings for the system are available in separate tabs, such as system resource utilization charts, system details, optimization approvals and modifying system attributes. See [Reviewing Specific Instance Details](#Lower_Section) for details on each tab.

## Reviewing the Instance Optimization Details Table

### Summary Bar

A summary bar showing the number of services and potentials savings is displayed at the top of the page. These values relate only to the content of the details page and not your total environment.

### Data Controls

The controls, in the upper right corner of the page, provide options for managing and viewing your data more effectively. See [Data Controls on Tabular Reports](./Navigating_Densify#Data_Controls) for more details.

### Tabular Report

The columns of the tabular report change depending on the selected instance type. Refer to the table below for details. See [Data Controls](#Data), above to search, sort, export and customize the table's content.

</td>

<p>When using pay-per-use pricing models, the amount of time each instance has been running, is required to accurately estimate future costs. </p>
<p>The predicted uptime (%) for a cloud instance or container, is based on the percentage of hours CPU utilization data is present in the historical interval, as specified in the policy settings for the entity. For <span class="mc-variable Document.ASG variable">Auto Scaling group</span>s and <span>VM Scale Set</span>s and Individual child instances are not taken into account.</p>
<p>Predicted uptime %, for new instances or containers, that started mid-way through the historical interval, is calculated from the time/date that the instance was started as opposed to the beginning of the interval, resulting in more accurate predictions for future usage.</p>
<p>For example, the uptime is the number of hours that have "CPU Utilization in mcores", and the range is the lesser of when the container was discovered, or the range defined in the policy. Looking at a specific container that was discovered on Jan 5th 2024, that has workload of 42 hours since that date, then the uptime % is 42 hrs/(13 days x 24 hrs/day) = 13.4%.

### Reviewing Specific Instance Details

Clicking on any row in the tabular report shows more detailed system information for that instance, in the 4 tabs, on the lower pane:

* Metrics Viewer--The link on the left side of the lower pane, opens the metrics viewer. You can use the metrics viewer to investigate details when deciding whether to action specific recommendations. See [Using the Metrics Viewer](./Using_the_Metrics_Viewer).
<Accordion title="Figure: Accessing the Metrics Viewer">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/06000128.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>
* Catalog Map--This link opens the Analysis Details page showing the chart displaying the available recommendation options for the selected instance. See [Using the Catalog Map](./Using_the_Catalog_Map) for details.
<Note>
The catalog map is not currently available for AWS ASGs or GCP instances.
</Note>

* Analysis Report--This link opens Impact Analysis and Recommendation Report report. See [Viewing the Public Cloud Impact Analysis and Recommendation Report](./Viewing_the_Impact_Analysis_and_Recommendation_Report)
* Resource Utilization Metrics: Cloud Tab--The charts on this tab show the utilization for various workloads for the selected instance.
<Note>
If no metrics are available, then the corresponding chart is not displayed.
</Note>



If a cloud instance has been optimized (i.e. instance type has been changed based on a recommendation), then on the next day you will see the Optimization Type set to "Just Right" and since the required data (as defined by the policy) has not been accumulated, only the Memory BackFill workload chart is displayed, if enabled. See the column, [Instance Type Updated On](#Inst_Updated) , above for more details.

These workload charts show hourly min/max and sustained activity for the selected system. Use the left/right arrows to scroll though the various workload charts.

Workload charts show current Sustained Activity in blue, while Sustained Activity on the recommended instance type is shown in green.

<Note>
When reviewing Optimal and Terminate recommendations the recommended instance type (green) is not applicable and so is not shown.
</Note>



The minimum and maximum utilization values are shown as vertical lines above and below the coloured block. The median is indicated as a black line within the coloured block. The average is indicated in brackets, in the sub-title of the chart.

The scale used on the Y-axis is scaled dynamically to match the range of data. Where applicable, the pink line indicating the policy high limit, is shown, and the setting of the Y-axis scale also accounts for the policy limit setting.

* System Information Tab--Click on this tab to see allocated resources and some of the organizational attributes that have been set for this guest.
* Effort Details Tab--This tab lists the factors that contribute to the effort required to investigate and implement the Densify recommendations. Effort for each instance is calculated by rule-driven analytics based on factors (such as instance family change, storage change, data quality checks, feature changes, etc.) that can be configured in the policy settings and through analysis rule sets. A description of each rule/property and its impact on the effort to move the current instance to the recommended instance type are provided.

Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for further details on the policy settings and rule set configured for your environment.

* Predicted Uptime Details Tab--This tab shows a pie chart with the uptime details for the selected instance.

In charts, workload data for each system is shown in four different bars (two yellow and two red), called quartiles, to show minimum, average, sustained and peak values. When used in the analysis, quartiles provide a good representation of system activity because the weighted scoring for sustained and peak activity produces a more accurate assessment of workload utilization patterns and requirements.

Quartiles are calculated in the following manner:

* Workload activity is collected every five minutes, which totals 12 times per hour.
* The 12 values are then re-ordered in descending order and separated into equal sample sizes (quartiles), with each quartile having three values. Each quartile represents 25% of operational time.
* The bottom of the first quartile shows the minimum value, the next quartile shows average values, the top of the third quartile shows the sustained value and the top of the fourth quartile shows the peak value.
