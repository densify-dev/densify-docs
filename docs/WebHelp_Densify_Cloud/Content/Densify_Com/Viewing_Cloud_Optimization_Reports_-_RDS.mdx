The results of Densify analyses are summarized in the various cloud service opportunity reports. Through these optimization reports Densify gives you the visibility to manage your workloads.

Cloud service opportunity reports are described in this topic for AWS RDS.

Details for the other tabs are provided in the following topics:

* AWS EC2--See [Viewing Cloud Optimization Reports](./Viewing_Cloud_Optimization_Reports)
* AWS Auto Scaling Groups--See
  [Working with Auto Scaling Groups](./Working_with_ASGs)
* Azure Virtual Machines--See [Viewing Cloud Optimization Reports](./Viewing_Cloud_Optimization_Reports)
* GCP Compute Engine--See [Viewing Cloud Optimization Reports](./Viewing_Cloud_Optimization_Reports)

<Note>
Instances without adequate data to perform the required analyses are not included in these reports.

## Filtering Options

You can filter the optimization opportunity reports by guests and instance attributes, as well as by recommendations.

<Accordion title="Figure: Accessing Filter Options ">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/03000111.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>

<Note>
The global filter is not applicable to the cloud optimization opportunities dashboards and is not accessible on these pages.
</Note>



### Filtering by Guest Attributes

You can filter instances using a set of attributes (e.g. Business Unit, Application).

This type of filtering is supported on the optimization opportunities dashboard tabs, as well as the Instance Optimization Details page when navigating from the Count column. The guest filters selected are persistent across platforms for those pages that support the guest filters (i.e. guest filters selected for AWS EC2 will apply to the AWS RDS, as well as the AWS Instance Optimization Details reports).

For details, see [Using the Guest Filter](./Using_Guest_Filters).

### Filtering by Recommendation

You can filter instances based on recommendations using the Recommendation Filter Menu. This filter allows you to narrow the results of your optimization reports based on recommended optimization type, effort required, monetary impact, and service characteristics. The resulting filtered report can be exported for external analysis using the Export to Excel (<InlineImage src="/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_Reporting_Framework/03000053_17x18.png"/>) tool.

For details, see [Using the Recommendation Filter Menu](./Using_the_Recommendation_Filter_Menu).

## Sorting Options

Optimization opportunity reports in tabular format can be sorted by the following fields:

* Overall Status & Optimization Type (default option)
* $ Savings/Month High to Low
* $ Savings/Month Low to High
* Effort None to Moderate
* Effort Moderate to None
* Current RI Expiry Date

Guest systems are sorted based on the selected sort option with any guest or recommendation filter already applied to the displayed results. The sorted report can be exported (in the same sort order) for external analysis using the Export to Excel tool.

The selected sort option is saved within the same session and will also be applied when you navigate to another tabular optimization opportunity report within the same public cloud environment supporting the sort option. For example, if you specify that the sort option is [Effort High to None](#Sort_EffortHighNone) in the AWS EC2 optimization opportunity report, then when you navigate to the AWS RDS optimization opportunity report, the sort option still remains [Effort High to None](#Sort_EffortHighNone). However, if you navigate to the Azure Virtual Machines optimization opportunity report, the sort option will change to the default or saved Azure sort option. When you logout of Densify, the sort option is reset to default sorting.
