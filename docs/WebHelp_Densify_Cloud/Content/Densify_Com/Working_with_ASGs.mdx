The Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) tab displays optimization opportunities for AWS Auto Scaling groups discovered through CloudWatch data collection. Optimization opportunities include group sizing and instance type recommendations based on predictive workload analytics.

<Accordion title="Video: Public Cloud AWS Auto-Scaling Groups Overview">
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="vidyard_iframe" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/372647271" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="630"></iframe>
</Accordion>


When working with ASGs note the following:

* EC2 instances that belong to an ASG are logically treated as part of the ASG service entity and recommendations are made for the group and not for the individual instances.
* Auto Scaling groups configured with maximum group size = 1, are only included in the EC2 tab. ASGs configured with maximum group size > 1, are included in the Auto Scaling Groups tab.
* If an ASG is associated with an ECS or EKS service, the Densify analysis requires additional information to ensure the ASG can satisfy all of the container reservation requests. Additional data should be collected by deploying the Densify container data forwarder into this cluster. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details.
* ASGs configured to use the 'Combined Purchasing Options and Instance Types' feature will have an attached policy that defines the mix of instance types on which the ASG can run. Densify cannot analyze these ASGs. However, an ASG with a mixed policy attached, can still be configured to run on one instance type. These ASGs can be analyzed.
* If memory data is not available for ASGs, memory utilization of the parent ECS or EKS service will be used and if that data is also not available, the backfill memory settings will be used for the analysis. See [ASG Backfilling Memory](#Backfill_Mem).

The ASG optimization opportunity report is divided into two sections:

* The [tabular report](#Tabular_Report) in the upper pane, shows details of the ASGs and their recommendations.
* [Tabs](#Lower_Pane) in the lower pane display the selected ASG's predicted scaling activity and resource utilization details. A third tab shows the effort required to implement the recommendations.

### Summary Bar

Summary totals are displayed in the upper right corner of the page. These totals are for the systems displayed on the current page and not all analyzed containers.

<Note>
This summary bar will not be updated based on the criteria in the table filter. See [Using the Table Filter](./Using_Container_Filters#Table_Filter)  for details on using the filter table.
</Note>


<Note>
When exported to .CSV the Total Savings value may not match the value in the exported .CSV file because the .CSV format does not support formulas and the total savings are a calculation per line, of the number of containers multiplied by savings.
Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details.
</Note>



### Data Controls

The controls, in the upper right corner of the page, provide options for managing and viewing your data more effectively. See [Data Controls on Tabular Reports](./Navigating_Densify#Data_Controls) for more details.

#### ASG Tabular Report Sorting

The ASG tabular report is ordered based on the following sorting keys:

<Accordion title="Table: ASG Sort Key Priority">
<table>
<col/>
<col/>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
<p>Sort Key</p>

<td>
<p>    1. <a class="RefToBookmarkNoPage MCXref xref xrefRefToBookmarkNoPage" href="#Reviewing_OverallStatus"><u>Overall Status</u></a></p>
</td>
<td>
<div>
<p>The Auto scaling groups are first sorted by Overall Status, in the following order:</p>
<ol class="ol_1">
<li value="1">Savings Opportunity</li>
<li value="2">Optimal</li>
<li value="3">Identified Risk</li>

</td>
<td>
<p>If the Overall Status is the same, then the secondary sort key is Optimization Type. ASGs are sorted by Optimization Type in the following order:</p>
<table>

</Accordion>


#### Filtering by Recommendation

You can filter the ASG optimization tabular report based on recommendations using the Recommendation Filter Menu. This filter allows you to narrow the results of your report based on overall status, optimization type, effort required and whether or not the recommendation should be deferred. For details, see [Using the Recommendation Filter Menu](./Using_the_Recommendation_Filter_Menu).

### Mixed Mode Services

Densify cannot analyze ASGs with a set of mixed instance types i.e. ASGs configured to use the 'Combined Purchasing Options and Instance Types' feature. However, an ASG with a mixed policy attached, can still be configured to run on one instance type and Densify can analyze these ASGs.

Densify checks the ASG's attached policy to determine if it is actually configured to run on a single instance type. Mixed groups are tagged by setting the attribute, "Mixed Instance Policy Set" to True and these ASGs are filtered from the analysis using the Cloud Environment filter.

Additionally, Densify detects mixed instance configurations that result from changes to the launch configuration/scale set model. When the configuration of an ASG changes then in the event of scale out, new instances are created based on the new configuration, while the existing child instances continue to run with the previous configuration.

In the event of a scale in, ASGs are typically set to favour terminating instance types created via the old launch template. This behaviour may result in a mix of instance types in the ASG.

Densify detects these changes and excludes services where the configuration of the ASG has changed but the running child-instances have not been affected.

### Tabular Data

The tabular report displays the current and recommended instance sizing and cost details for each ASG associated with downsizing, upsizing, or modernizing the instance type in the ASG's configuration. See the recommended [Instance Type](#Reviewing_Catalog) column for instance sizing recommendations.

The report also displays recommended group sizing associated with downscaling or upscaling the ASG. See the [Min Group Size](#Reviewing_ASGMinSize) or the [Current Maximum Size](#Reviewing_ASGMaxSize) columns for the recommended group size. Refer to [Reviewing the ASG Optimization Opportunity Report Columns](#Reviewing_ASGComponent) for a description of the ASG tabular report columns.

### Reviewing Specific Instance Details

The bottom pane of the ASG report provides the following information for the ASG, selected in the tabular report:

* Metrics Viewer--The link in the left side of the lower pane, opens the metrics viewer. You can use the metrics viewer to investigate details when deciding whether to action specific recommendations. See [Using the Metrics Viewer](./Using_the_Metrics_Viewer).
<Accordion title="Figure: Accessing the Metrics Viewer">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/06000141.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


* In Service Instances--Shows workload charts for current and recommended predicted scaling activities for the selected ASG. For ASGs identified as "Just Right" or "Terminate" (optimization type), only the current in-service auto scaling activity chart is displayed.
* ASG Utilization --Shows charts for current and recommended CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization for the selected ASG. Network I/O, Disk I/O workload charts are also included, showing utilization at the ASG level. For ASGs belonging to ECS clusters, additional CPU and Memory Reservation charts are displayed. You can view workload charts for each group member from the [Working with Auto Scaling Groups](#ASGInServiceInstanceDetails) page.
* Effort Details Tab--This table lists the factors that contribute to the effort required to investigate and implement the Densify recommendations. Effort for each group is calculated by rule-driven analytics based on factors (such as instance family change, data quality checks, feature changes, etc.) that can be configured in the policy settings and through analysis rule sets. A description of each rule and its impact on the effort to implement the recommended changes are provided.

### Additional Considerations for ASG Recommendations

#### EKS-aware ASG Recommendations

ASGs and their EC2 group members are loaded from AWS audits and Kubernetes entities are collected via the Densify Data Forwarder from Prometheus data. Linking these entities is extremely complex as even the Kubernetes cluster names may not match.

A single Kubernetes cluster can run on one or more ASG with each ASG running in a node group within the cluster; however it is possible to skip node groups, and in this case the ASG must be linked directly to the cluster entity.

Densify matches, counts and links entities and ASG recommendations are made based on the established EKS-ASG associations.

</Accordion>


#### ASG Backfilling Memory

If you are not collecting memory metrics, Densify provides a method to simulate memory utilization using backfill memory policy settings. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details.
