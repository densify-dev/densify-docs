title: "Approving Cloud Recommendations"
---

The ability to approve or pre-approve recommended actions, for the purpose of automation or manual implementation, can be achieved through the Instance Optimization Details report. For an automated self-optimizing solution, Densify offers a framework to identify which instances are suitable for self-optimization based on Densify's recommended action and the effort to implement the action. When an instance is identified as requiring an optimizing action, you can approve or disallow the action. All instance optimization, instance approval, and self-optimizing details are accessible via the Densify API, which is used to extract data for downstream processing, either manually or in an integrated infrastructure execution application, such as Terraform. See [Enabling Self-Aware Self-Optimizing Instances](./Enabling_Self-Aware_Self-Optimizing_Instances) for a high-level overview of this process.

The Self-Optimizing Automation process flow is depicted in the diagram below.

1. Before using the Self-Optimizing Automation feature, the implementation method policies and any system overrides need to be configured to identify which Optimization Types (recommended actions) are allowed for self-optimization. In Densify, the Self-Optimizing Automation implementation method selected is dependent on the Optimization Type and may also depend on calculated Effort required to implement the recommendation. These are configured in the cloud environment policy.

Contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for details on the Self-Optimizing Automation policy settings and system overrides for your environment.

2. For each instance recommendation, you can approve the move to a specific instance type or pre-approve any instance type recommendation. The default setting for each instance recommendation is "Not Approved".
3. The instance optimization, instance approval and self-optimizing details can be retrieved by the Densify API for manual or automation purposes, such as updating Terraform templates for instance optimization automation.

Contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you want to explore Self-Optimizing Automation solutions using the Densify API. You can also refer to the Densify [API Reference Guide](https://www.densify.com/docs-api/Content/APIHome) for usage details and examples.

## Approvals Tab

The Approvals tab in the Instance Optimization Details report is available for the following cloud instances:

* AWS EC2
* AWS RDS
* AWS Spot Instances
* Azure Virtual Machines
* GCP Compute Engines

The approval setting is configured for a single instance at a time; bulk approvals are not allowed. The Approvals tab will not be available when you select multiple instances in the Instance Optimization Details report.

<Note>
If there are conflicting instance details, then the Approvals tab will unavailable and an appropriate error will be displayed. For example, if optimization analysis was conducted for an instance and recommendations were provided, but the instance no longer exists, then an error will be displayed in the Approvals tab.
</Note>



### Filtering by Approval Setting

You can filter instances in supported reports with a specific Approval Setting through the Guest Filter. By default, instances with all Approval Settings are displayed. This filtering option is supported in the following cloud optimization reports:

* Public Cloud > Optimization Overview
* Public Cloud > AWS > EC2
* Public Cloud > AWS > RDS
* Public Cloud > AWS > Spot Instances
* Public Cloud > Azure > Virtual Machines
* Public Cloud > GCP > Compute Engines
* Instance Optimization Details

See [Using the Guest Filter](./Using_Guest_Filters) for details on the Guest Filter.

<Note>
The guest filter supports dynamic filtering for the Approval Setting. If a new Approval Setting value has been set, the guest filter refreshes with the new value in the Densify Console.
