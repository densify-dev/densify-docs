## Containers

When you want to analyze your container environments, you need to configure and deploy the Data forwarder in your Kubernetes or OpenShift environment. Once data is being sent to Densify the process is the same as public cloud, you log into a secure SaaS instance to access your optimization reports.

Get started immediately: See [Container Data Collection Prerequisites](../Data_Collection_for_Public_Cloud_Systems/Container_Data_Collection_Prerequisites) for details.

Specifications, instructions and the user interface are subject to change without notice.

## Public Cloud

For cloud environments, Densify uses the cloud connection wizard from within your secure, dedicated SaaS instance to create connections to your public cloud APIs. Within 24 hours your data has been collected and analyzed and can be reviewed through the same SaaS instance.

Get started immediately: See [Data Collection for Public Cloud Systems](../Data_Collection_for_Public_Cloud_Systems/Data_Collection_for_Public_Cloud_Systems) for details creating connections to your public cloud providers.
