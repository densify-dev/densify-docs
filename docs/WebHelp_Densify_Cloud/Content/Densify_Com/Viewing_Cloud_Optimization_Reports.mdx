The results of Densify analyses are summarized in the various cloud-specific optimization overview reports. Through these optimization reports Densify gives you the visibility to manage your workloads in multi-cloud environments.

Components described in this topic are available in the following cloud service optimization reports:

<p>History of Optimal Services (%)</p>

<p>The line chart  shows the number of instances that are sized correctly over time. For each date, optimal service percentage is calculated as the ratio of (the number of systems that are sized correctly) divided by (the total number of systems, defined by the set of filters on that day). The axis scales based on the amount of data up to the maximum of 6 months. If you hover over any data point in the graph a popup indicates the percentage of systems that are "Just Right" on the selected date. As you apply the recommendations, the number of right-sized instances should increase over time. </p>

### Other Features of the Tabular Report

A row at the bottom of the table provides totals for each column. You may need to scroll down through the report to see the totals if your the report is long. Columns that report on the number of instances are provided as hyperlinks when the value is greater than 0. The link takes you to the Instance Optimization Details report. See [Understanding the Instance Optimization Details Report](./Understanding_the_Instance_Details_Report).

A footnote at the bottom of this report indicates the estimated costs are based on the instance cost and the predicted uptime.

## Grouping and Filtering Options

You can filter the optimization opportunity reports by instances and instance attributes, as well as by recommendations.

<Accordion title="Figure: Accessing Grouping and Filtering Options ">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/03000111.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>

<Note>
The global filter is not applicable to the cloud optimization opportunities dashboards and is not accessible on these pages.
</Note>



### Filtering by Instance Attributes

You can filter instances using a set of attributes (e.g. Business Unit, Application).

This type of filtering is supported on the optimization opportunities dashboard tabs, as well as the Instance Optimization Details page when navigating from the Count column. The guest filters selected are persistent across platforms for those pages that support the guest filters (i.e. guest filters selected for AWS EC2 will apply to the AWS RDS, AWS Spot Instances, as well as the AWS Instance Optimization Details reports).

For details, see [Using the Guest Filter](./Using_Guest_Filters).

### Grouping Data by Instance Attributes

The Group By option allows you to group results by properties and tags. Your selection defines the structure of various tabular reports.

</Accordion>


For details, see [Using the Group By Feature](./Using_the_Group_By_Feature).

### Filtering by Recommendation

You can filter instances based on recommendations using the Recommendation Filter Menu. This filter allows you to narrow the results of your optimization reports based on recommended optimization type, effort required, monetary impact, and service characteristics.

For details, see [Using the Recommendation Filter Menu](./Using_the_Recommendation_Filter_Menu).

Filtering by Recommendation

## Exporting Tabular Report

Once you have defined the filters to view a specific set of systems you can export the tabular view for external analysis.

Click the Export to Excel icon in the top right corner of the screen. See [Exporting Report Data](./Exporting_Report_Data) for details.
