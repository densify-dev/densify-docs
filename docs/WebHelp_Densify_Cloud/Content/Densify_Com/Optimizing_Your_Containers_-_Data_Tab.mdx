title: "Optimizing Your Containers - Data Tab"
---

The Kubernetes Container Optimization report provides a summary of optimization opportunities and ways to mitigate risk for your container environments.

<Accordion title="Video: Investigating Your Container Recommendations">
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="vidyard_iframe" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/653796049" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="630"></iframe>
</Accordion>

Data is displayed as charts on the [Summary](./Optimizing_Your_Containers#Summary_tab) tab or as detailed tabular data on the Data tab, covered here. There are two additional tabs in the lower pane: [Cluster Breakdown](#Cluster_Breakdown_Tab) and [Allocation](#Allocation_Tab).

</Accordion>

### Grouping and Filtering Your Container Data

You can group and filter your data using the following options:

* Group By—See [Using the Group By Feature](./Using_the_Group_By_Feature);
* Container Filter—See [Using Container Filters](./Using_Container_Filters).

Filter settings defined using any of the above options are persistent between user login sessions, for this page.

When you export the content of a report with filters applied, the filtered set of systems is exported for the Data and Details tabs.

### Summary Banner

Key metrics are displayed in a banner at the top of the report.  If you have applied filters the totals displayed in this summary reflect the filtered results.  The values, in the Summary bar are not affected by the [Group By feature](./Using_the_Group_By_Feature). See [Reviewing the Summary Tab](./Optimizing_Your_Containers#Summary_tab) for details of the key metrics.

### Data Controls

The controls, in the upper right corner of the page, provide options for managing and viewing your data more effectively. See [Data Controls on Tabular Reports](./Navigating_Densify#Data_Controls) for more details.

### Viewing the Tabular Data - Top Pane

The breakdown of the data for your aggregated container environments is displayed on the top pane of this tab. You can control how the data is displayed in this table using the Group By feature. The Group By setting is used in the first column and data is retrieved and displayed accordingly.

For example, if you wanted to group the data based on Business Unit, Densify displays the analyzed data sorted based on the value of the Business Unit resource tag. See [Using the Group By Feature](./Using_the_Group_By_Feature).

The top table provides a breakdown as follows:

### Allocation Tab - Lower Pane

The allocation details of the row, selected in the top table is expanded and displayed on this tab in the lower part of the page. The Allocation tab provides more detailed allocation data for the selected row.

Based on the row selected in the top table, the following values are calculated:

* Average—for the selected row the average is calculated as (total / # of containers);
* Maximum—The maximum value of all the items for the selected row;
* Minimum—The minimum value of all the items for the selected row;
* Total—The total values of all the items for the selected row.

Calculations only include containers where a request or limit value has been specified.
