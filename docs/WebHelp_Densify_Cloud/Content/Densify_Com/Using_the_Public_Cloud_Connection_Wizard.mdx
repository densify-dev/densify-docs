title: "Using the Public Cloud Connections Wizard"
---

The Public Cloud Connections wizard guides you through the steps to create and schedule daily data collection from your public cloud instances. Collected configuration and workload data is then analyzed and used to recommend sizing and placement optimization opportunities.

The Public Cloud Connections wizard is accessible from the Densify Console's landing page or from the Public Cloud > dropdown menu.

<Accordion title="Figure: Accessing the Cloud Connections Wizard">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/06000236_282x182.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


The following cloud platforms are supported through the Public Cloud Connections wizard:

* [Amazon Web Services](#AWS_Connection)
* [Azure Cloud](#Azure_Connection)
* [Google Cloud Platform](#GCP_Connection)

You can modify the connections once they have been created:

* [Edit Connections](#Edit_Conn)
* [Review Connections](#Review_Conn)
* [Configure Public Cloud Connections to use a Proxy Server](#Configuring_a_Proxy_Server)
* [Delete Connections](#Deleting)
* [Change Credentials](#Changing_Credentials)

Additionally, you can collect and analyze AWS data through the Densify API. Refer to the following use cases for an example of API data collection:

* [Optimizing AWS EC2 Instances](https://densify.com/docs-api/WebHelp_Densify_API_Cloud/Content/API_Guide/Optimizing_AWS_EC2_Instances)
* [Optimizing Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Instances](https://densify.com/docs-api/WebHelp_Densify_API_Cloud/Content/API_Guide/Optimizing_Microsoft_Azure_Virtual_Machine_Instances)
* [Optimizing GCP Compute Engine Instances](https://densify.com/docs-api/WebHelp_Densify_API_Cloud/Content/API_Guide/Optimizing_GCP_Compute_Engine_Instances)

### Considerations when Working with Large Environments

In large environments, Densify highly recommends batching your accounts into smaller groups for improved performance when creating the cloud connections. i.e. 10 accounts at a time. You can use a resource tag, such as organization or business unit to split the total number of accounts so that data is collected in manageable batches.

## Configuring a Connection to AWS

You can connect to your AWS account with the following method:

* IAM User and Access keys--This process prompts you to enter your AWS credentials for either configuration/workload data. Your information is verified and can then be saved. Densify then creates the required audits and analyses and schedules them to run regularly.
* IAM Role--An IAM cross-account role that establishes a trust relationship between AWS accounts. In order to create the connection you need the prerequisite information, including the external ID and Role ARN. See:

* [AWS Data Collection Using a CloudFormation Template](../Data_Collection_for_Public_Cloud_Systems/AWS_Data_Collection_Using_a_CloudFormation_Template) for details on collecting resource utilization data.
