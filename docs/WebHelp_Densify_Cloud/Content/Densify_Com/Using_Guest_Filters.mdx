All three cloud platforms support user-defined resource tags to categorize your cloud utilization data. The guest filter is based on these resource tags so you need to tag your instances to sort and filter your collected utilization data and take advantage of Densify's reporting features.

These user-defined tags must be mapped to Densify attributes. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details..

The Group By features located at the right side of group filter allows you to group you data using the using the same user-defined resource tags/attributes that are used by the guest filter. See [Viewing Cloud Optimization Reports](./Viewing_Cloud_Optimization_Reports#GroupBy) for details.

## Reports with the Guest Filter

The following reports allow you to filter instances using the guest filter:

* Public Cloud > Optimization Overview
* Public Cloud > Amazon Web Services > EC2 | RDS Optimization Reports
* Public Cloud > Microsoft Azure > Virtual Machines Optimization Reports
* Public Cloud > Google Cloud  > Compute Engine Optimization Reports

### Stale Data

Stale recommendations occur when data is not collected on its regular schedule, resulting in the last available recommendation, which could be months old, being displayed in the Densify Console. Environments and systems with data older than 30 days are not included in dashboards or reports.

The number of days, after which data is considered stale is configurable. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details.

When using the guest filter, if you filter on an account with stale data, you will see the message, No Data Available. This also applies to individual systems with stale data. These systems are not included in the totals on the overview and instance optimization details pages.

## Using the Guest Filter

You can apply guest filters to report on a smaller, more manageable set of guests. To define a filter, from the Guest Filters strip at the top of the page:

1. Select your specific filter drop-down and select the options to include.

"All" is used to indicate no filtering is defined. If you select a single, item, then that item is displayed. If you select more than one item, but not all items, then "Multiple" is displayed.

2. You can use the search feature to find specific attributes/tags/strings. See [Using the Filter's Search Feature](#Search).
3. Check the footnote at the bottom of the dialog box to see details about the filtered list. The total number of records are listed. If you are using the search feature, the footnote indicates how many items contain the search criteria and the total number of records.

The footnote does not tell you how many items have been selected. The number of selected items is shown at the top of the list.

4. Click OK to set this filter.
5. Click the More Filters link to define other filter criteria.
6. Click the Apply button to update the page with the filter you have defined.

You can click the Apply button at any time to refresh the filter settings. This includes adding/removing any new pick list values in the selection lists, that may have changed after recent data collection. It also and includes any updates the listed systems based on changes made to dynamic attributes.

7. Click Reset to return all of the filter settings to their defaults.

The entire page, including the blue Summary banner at the top of the page, is refreshed when the guest filter is applied.

If, after applying the filter, no records meet the specified criteria, you will see the message "No Data Available".

Clicking the Reset button also adds/removes any new pick list values in the selection lists and updates the listed systems based on changes made to dynamic attributes.

### Persisting Filter Settings Across Pages

The selected filter options are persistent across platform-specific optimization reports that support filtering. For example, the selected guest filters applied to the AWS EC2 report are also applied to the AWS RDS, ASG, and Spot Instances pages..

Since all cloud platforms (AWS, Azure and GCP) are aggregated on the Cloud Optimization dashboard, the guest filter is separately persistent for that tab. Settings are persistent between the Optimization Overview >Summary and Data tabs.

<Note>
The guest filter is not displayed on the Instance Optimization Details reports.
</Note>



The guest filtering options also persist across user login sessions. When you log out and log back into Densify, your filter selections are retained for the Cloud Optimization pages and for any drill-down reports that support guest filtering.

When you are filtering on the AWS Account | Azure Subscription | GCP Project option, the filter drop-down list shows the account, subscription or project name (if available) and the account number. i.e. "Engineering Dev (1234567890)”. If the account, subscription or project name is not available, or is the same as the account number, then only the account number is used. i.e. "1234567890".
