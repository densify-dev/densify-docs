The Instance Optimization Details report displays instance-specific details for RDS instance types.

Open the Instance Optimization Details report, by clicking on a hyperlinked value in the Count column from the RDS optimization opportunity tabular report.

Instance optimization details for the other tabs are provided in the following topics:

* AWS EC2 is covered in [Understanding the Instance Optimization Details Report](./Understanding_the_Instance_Details_Report).
* AWS ASGs are covered in [Working with Auto Scaling Groups](./Working_with_ASGs).
* Azure and GCP are covered in [Understanding the Instance Optimization Details Report](./Understanding_the_Instance_Details_Report).

<Note>
Cloud instances that do not have adequate information for recommendation analysis are not included in the Instance Optimization Details report. For example, this would include guests with no data or incomplete benchmark data.

<p>Predicted Uptime (%)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>When using pay-per-use pricing models, we need to know the amount of time each instance has been running to accurately estimate future costs. </p>
<p>The predicted uptime (%) for a cloud instance or container, is based on the percentage of hours CPU utilization data is present in the historical interval, as specified in the policy settings for the entity. For <span class="mc-variable Document.ASG variable">Auto Scaling group</span>s and <span>VM Scale Set</span>s and Individual child instances are not taken into account.</p>
<p>Predicted uptime %, for new instances or containers, that started mid-way through the historical interval, is calculated from the time/date that the instance was started as opposed to the beginning of the interval, resulting in more accurate predictions for future usage.</p>
<p>For example, the uptime is the number of hours that have "CPU Utilization in mcores", and the range is the lesser of when the container was discovered, or the range defined in the policy. Looking at a specific container that was discovered on Jan 5th 2024, that has workload of 42 hours since that date, then the uptime % is 42 hrs/(13 days x 24 hrs/day) = 13.4%. This is the value shown in this column.</p>

### Reviewing Specific Instance Details

Clicking on any row in the tabular report shows more detailed system information for that instance, in the tabs on the lower pane:

* Metrics Viewer--The link on the left side of the lower pane, opens the metrics viewer. You can use the metrics viewer to investigate details when deciding whether to action specific recommendations. See [Using the Metrics Viewer](./Using_the_Metrics_Viewer).
<Accordion title="Figure: Accessing the Metrics Viewer">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/06000128.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>
* Catalog Map--This link opens the Analysis Details page showing the chart displaying the available recommendation options for the selected instance. See [Using the Catalog Map](./Using_the_Catalog_Map) for details.
* Analysis Report--This link opens Impact Analysis and Recommendation Report report. See [Viewing the Public Cloud Impact Analysis and Recommendation Report](./Viewing_the_Impact_Analysis_and_Recommendation_Report)
* Analysis Report--This link opens Impact Analysis and Recommendation Report report. See [Viewing the Public Cloud Impact Analysis and Recommendation Report](./Viewing_the_Impact_Analysis_and_Recommendation_Report)
* Resource Utilization Metrics: Cloud Tab--The charts on this tab show the utilization for various workloads for the selected the instance.
<Note>
If no metrics are available, then the corresponding chart is not displayed.
</Note>



If a cloud instance has been optimized (i.e. instance type has been changed based on a recommendation), then on the next day you will see the Optimization Type set to "Just Right" and since the required data (as defined by the policy) has not been accumulated, only the Memory BackFill workload chart is displayed, if enabled. See the column, [Instance Type Updated On](#Inst_Updated), in Table: Instance Optimization Details Tabular Report Columns, above for more details.

These workload charts show hourly min/max and sustained activity for the selected system. Use the left/right arrows to scroll though the various workload charts.

Workload charts show current Sustained Activity in blue, while Sustained Activity on the recommended instance type is shown in green.

<Note>
The recommended instance type (green) is not applicable and so is not shown for Optimal and Terminate recommendations.
</Note>



The minimum and maximum utilization values are shown as vertical lines above and below the coloured block. The median is indicated as a black line within the coloured block. The average is indicated in brackets, in the sub-title of the chart.

The scale used on the Y-axis is scaled dynamically to match the range of data. Where applicable, the pink line indicating the policy high limit, is shown, and the setting of the Y-axis scale also accounts for the policy limit setting. This is applicable to both public cloud and virtual optimization charts for Resource Utilization Metrics.

* System Information Tab--Click on this tab to see allocated resources and some of the organizational attributes that have been set for this guest.
* Effort Details Tab--This tab lists the factors that contribute to the effort required to investigate and implement the Densify recommendations. Effort for each instance is calculated by rule-driven analytics based on factors (such as instance family change, storage change, data quality checks, feature changes, etc.) that can be configured in the policy settings and through analysis rule sets. A description of each rule/property and its impact on the effort to move the current instance to the recommended instance type are provided.

Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for further details on the policy settings and rule set configured for your environment.

* Predicted Uptime Details Tab--This tab shows a pie chart with the uptime details for the selected instance.
* Approvals Tab--This tab is no longer in use and will be removed in a future release.
* Edit System Attributes Tab----This tab is no longer in use and will be removed in a future release.

#### Quartiles in the Resource Utilization Charts

<Accordion title="Video: Quartiles Explained">
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="vidyard_iframe" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/356956354" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="630"></iframe>
</Accordion>


In charts, workload data for each system is shown in four different bars (two yellow and two red), called quartiles, to show minimum, average, sustained and peak values. When used in the analysis, quartiles provide a good representation of system activity because the weighted scoring for sustained and peak activity produces a more accurate assessment of workload utilization patterns and requirements.

Quartiles are calculated in the following manner:

* Workload activity is collected every five minutes, which totals 12 times per hour.
* The 12 values are then re-ordered in descending order and separated into equal sample sizes (quartiles), with each quartile having three values. Each quartile represents 25% of operational time.
* The bottom of the first quartile shows the minimum value, the next quartile shows average values, the top of the third quartile shows the sustained value and the top of the fourth quartile shows the peak value.

</Accordion>

### Editing System Attributes

The Edit System Attributes tab in the lower pane of the Instance Optimization Details report allows you to edit specific attributes of the system selected from the top pane.

This feature is also supported via the Densify API. Refer to the API documentation.

<Accordion title="Figure: Edit System Attributes Tab">
<Frame>![](/images/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Resources/Images/Cirba_SaaS/06000031.png)</Frame>
</Accordion>


The following default system attribute categories are available for editing:

* Business

Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) if you require additional system attributes to be exposed for editing.

Attribute changes are displayed accordingly in the Edit Systems Attributes tab.

Densify optimization and reporting database updates are required before the saved values are reflected in the Instance Optimization Details tabular report and footer. For example, if you update and save one of the Self-Optimizing Automation Overrides attributes, you can see the updated value in the Edit Systems Attributes tab and extract the updated attribute value from the Densify API. However, the Instance Optimization Details tabular report and footer will not display the recommendation results of the updated value until analysis has been performed and the reporting tables have been updated via the overnight scheduled job.
