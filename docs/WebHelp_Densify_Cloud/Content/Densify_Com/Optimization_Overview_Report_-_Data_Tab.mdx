title: "Optimization Overview Report - Data Tab"
---

The Optimization Overview report provides a summary of optimization opportunities and ways to mitigate risk for your public cloud instances. This report aggregates the analysis results for all your public cloud platforms.

Data is displayed as charts on the [Summary](./Viewing_the_Optimization_Overview_Report) tab or as detailed tabular data on the **Data** tab, covered here.

You can group and filter your data using the following options:

* Group By --See [Using the Group By Feature](./Using_the_Group_By_Feature);
* Recommendation Filter Menu--See [Using the Recommendation Filter Menu](./Using_the_Recommendation_Filter_Menu);
* Guest filter--See [Using the Guest Filter](./Using_Guest_Filters) and for details on configuring and using these filters.

Filter settings defined using any of the above options are persistent between user login sessions, for this page.

### Summary Banner

Key metrics are displayed in a banner at the top of the report. Â If you have applied filters, the totals, displayed in this summary, reflect the filtered results. See [Summary Banner](./Viewing_the_Optimization_Overview_Report#Summary_Banner) for details.

### Data Controls

The controls, in the upper right corner of the page, provide options for managing and viewing your data more effectively. See [Data Controls on Tabular Reports](./Navigating_Densify#Data_Controls) for more details.

### Tabular Data

The breakdown of the data for your aggregated cloud environment is displayed on this tab. You can control how the data is displayed in this table using the **Group By** feature. The **Group By** setting is used in the first column and data is retrieved and displayed accordingly.

For example, if you wanted to group the data based on Business Unit, Densify displays the analyzed data sorted based on the value of the Business Unit resouce tag. See [Using the Group By Feature](./Using_the_Group_By_Feature).

The top table provides a breakdown as follows:

        <br />
        This information can be useful when a group contains ASG instances.
        <br />
        The average number of systems in the ASG is used for these value so the values shown in these 2 columns may not always be an integer. This average instance count can be found when you drill down to the Instance Optimization Details report in the "Current Predicted Average Instance Count" and "Recommended Predicted Average Instance Count" columns.
        <br />
        Additionally, you may observe that these values may not match the value of the Total Services. This happens because child ASGs are included in this calculation, whereas the Total Services only contains the parent ASG.

### Details Tab

The details of the row selected in the top table is expanded and displayed on two tabs on the lower part of the page. The **Details** tab provides a subset of the information from the top of the page, for only the selected row, expanded by Service Type and sorted by **Service Type** and Overall Status, rather than aggregated.

Additionally, any filter criteria selected in the Guest Filter and Recommendation Filter are applied to the date displayed on both the **Details** and **Allocations and Utilization** tabs.

<Note>
In the following table, costs, savings, vCPU/memory surplus values and totals are estimated based on per instance costs and allocations, predicted uptime and predicted average instance counts. This is indicated as a footnote as the bottom of the page.

### Allocations and Utilization Tab

The allocation and utilization details of the row selected in the top table is expanded and displayed on this tab in the lower part of the page. The **Allocations and Utilization** tab provides a subset of the information shown at the top of the page, but only for the selected row.

<Note>
In the following table, all allocations totals are estimated based on per instance allocations, predicted uptime and predicted average instance counts. This is indicated in a footonote as the bottom of the page.
</Note>


<Note>
In the following table, some values may not match the aggegated totals shown in the tabular report at the top of the page. This is due to how ASG and VMÂ scale set utilization is calculated.
</Note>



For each set of systems the average, maximum, minimum and total values are shown for each column.

Please observe the following for this set of data:

* The Average Utilization % value is calculated as the weighted average of the utilization % for all of the systems in the selected group. This is applicable to the current and recommended Utilization % for CU and memory.
* Systems with missing data are excluded from the calculations;
* If there is no data for a whole group of systems, then this is indicated as a dash (-);
* Systems with a "Terminate" recommendation are excluded from the calculations in all of the "Recommended" columns. For example, if all systems in the group are 'Terminate', then all of the "Recommended" columns will be shown as a dash (-);
