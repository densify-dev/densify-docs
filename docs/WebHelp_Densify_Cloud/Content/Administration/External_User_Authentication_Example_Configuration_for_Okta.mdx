You can use the following process to setup Okta for Authorization Code Flow:

### Authorization Server

Densify requires the use of a custom authorization server. If you do not already have an authorization server configured, please contact Okta directly, for details.

Okta's API Access Management product is a requirement to use a custom authorization server and is an optional add-on in production environments. See [Authorization Servers Concepts](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/).

You need to register Densify as a web application in your Okta Authorization Server. and then provide the following information to Densify:
