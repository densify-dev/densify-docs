## Overview

The Densify catalog map allows you to view a range of recommended instance type options. The map view shows the AWS or Azure catalog scored for your selected workload using Densify's analytics.
<Note>
**Note:** The catalog map is **not** currently available for ASGs, VM Scale Sets or any GCP cloud instances.
</Note>

Filters allow you to limit the catalog based on items such as processor type, processor features and instance cost.

### Page Navigation

The catalog map is displayed only when a single AWS and Azure cloud instance is selected in the tree viewer.

### Catalog Map Controls

The catalog map is populated with the analysis results for the single instance, selected in the tree viewer. Select any single AWS or Azure instance to see its map. The cloud provider's catalog options and the available instance sizes and their scores for the selected workload comprise the catalog map.

Use the following options to configure this report:



<Accordion title="Table: Catalog Map Controls">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Default</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Show Instance Types that are:</td>
      <td>Commonly used options, that are available in the selected region are shown as a comma-separated list</td>
      <td>
        Select one or more of the following options to filter the list of instance types to be displayed in the catalog map.
        <ul>
          <li>Commonly used--Instances that are used by less than 0.5% of Densify customers are considered to be NOT commonly used. These "exotic" instances are not included in the chart, unless the "Commonly Used" option is deselected.</li>
          <li>Available in the current region--Instance types available in the same region as the selected service.</li>
          <li>Meeting all policies--Instance types that comply with all policy settings that have been defined for the selected service.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Intel</li>

          <li>ARM</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spend Tolerance</td>
      <td>5X more than optimal</td>
      <td>
        Specify a spend tolerance value that determines cost compatibility. For example, selecting a value of 20% means that instance types that cost up to 20% more than the optimal instance type are considered compatible. You can choose a spend tolerance ranging from the exact cost of the optimal instance (No more than optimal) to no cost limit (Unlimited).
        Spend tolerance impacts the compatibility status of instance types that are technically compatible based on resource requirements. If an instance exceeds the specified spend tolerance, it will be shown in yellow to indicate it is technically compatible but not cost-efficient. As you increase the spend tolerance, more instance types will be within the acceptable range and change from yellow to green, indicating both technical and cost compatibility.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Highlight Instance Features</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        Select one or more instance features that may improve the performance of your workload. Values displayed in this dropdown are based on the selected region and cloud provider.
        Selections are shown in the dropdown window as comma-separated values.
        Instance types with the selected features are not highlighted for services with a terminate recommendation.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</Accordion>




The chart is refreshed immediately when you change any of the control options. Your settings are saved for the current user session and are returned to the default values if you log out or if another user opens the viewer.

### Catalog Map Legend

The score shown in each cell in the catalog map is based on the current utilization and Densify's analysis results. These calculations account for both compatibility of the workload with an instance type's features and its monthly cost.

All instances that have been evaluated are displayed with their score displayed in colour-coded squares:

### Summary Table

A summary table showing details of the current and recommended (optimal) instance type is displayed below the catalog map.

![](/images/docs-kubex/Content/Cloudex/03000003_757x137.png)
</Frame>


You can select a third instance in the map to view its details and compare it to the current and recommended instance types:

Press Esc on your keyboard, or click the same tile again to cancel the selection.

Click on another tile to compare another instance type.
