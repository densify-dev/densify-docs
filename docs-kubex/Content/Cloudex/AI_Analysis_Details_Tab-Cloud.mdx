</Note>

## Searching for Systems

You can search the table for a specific system or set of systems.


<ol start="1">
  <li>Enter your search criteria in the search bar, located in the upper right of the page.</li>
  <li>The table contents update as you enter your search parameters.</li>
  <li>Click the X in the search box to clear the search parameters.</li>
</ol>


Kubex or Cloudex only searches the scope of systems that are currently displayed. You may need to expand your scope of systems if your systems are not found.

## Column Filters

You can apply various filters to customize the scope of containers or cloud instance you are reviewing in the table. See [Using Filters](/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/Using_Filters).

## Exporting Data

You can export tabular reports from this tab to Microsoft® Excel.


<ol>
  <li>Select the table view and adjust views and filters to obtain the desired set of data.</li>
  <li>Click the export icon, located beside the **Table View** drop down menu.</li>
</ol>

When the content of the AI Analysis Details is exported, entity names that are provided as a [hyperlink](/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/Visualizing_Your_Data#deep-links) are included in the exported XLS file. When you open the exported .XLS file, the URL content initially appears as plain text, and when you click on the cell it becomes a hyperlink.

## Table Views

A number of pre-configured views enable you to see analysis results that are applicable to your specific use case. Each pre-defined view has only the applicable columns enabled and filters have been set to include only systems that meet certain criteria.
Details of all pre-configured views are provided in [AI Analysis Details Table](/docs-kubex/Content/Cloudex/AI_Analysis_Details_Table-Cloud).
