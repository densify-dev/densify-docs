## Required User Roles

When working with cloud connections, all users can access and view the cloud connections page.

Only a user assigned to the "SaaS\_Audit\_Admin" group can create public cloud connections. See [Managing Densify User Accounts](/docs/WebHelp_Densify_Cloud/Content/Densify_Com/Managing_Densify_User_Accounts) for details on adding the role to your user account.

## Considerations when Working with Large Environments

In large environments, Densify highly recommends batching your accounts into smaller groups for improved performance when creating the cloud connections. i.e. 10 accounts at a time. You can use a resource tag, such as organization or business unit to split the total number of accounts so that is collected in manageable batches
