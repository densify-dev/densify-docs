Densify recommends using the [Kubex Automation Stack Helm Chart](https://github.com/densify-dev/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/kubex-automation-stack). This Helm chart bundles all of the components required for Kubex and is the preferred method of data collection.
The following configuration options support multi-cluster configurations and observability platforms. See [Container Data Collection Prerequisites](/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/Data_Collection_Prerequisites) for required prerequisite software.



<Accordion title="OpenShift">
In this configuration you can deploy the <span>data forwarder</span> with OpenShift (e.g. Authenticated Prometheus). Refer to  <a href="https://github.com/densify-dev/container-data-collection/tree/main/single-cluster/examples/bearer-openshift">Example: bearer-openshift</a> for details.

See <a href="/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/Data_Collection_Prerequisites">Container Data Collection Prerequisites</a> for details on prerequisite software.
</Accordion>






<Accordion title="Amazon Managed Prometheus">
In this example the data forwarder is setup in an EKS cluster to connect to Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP) and send container data to <span>Densify</span> on an hourly basis. Using an EKS cluster allows you to use EKS's ability to associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account and configure your pods to use the service account. This is the preferred way to connect to AMP.

- Supports EKS as well as other Amazon Kubernetes deployments

- See https://github.com/densify-dev/container-data-collection/tree/main/multi-cluster/examples/amp for details on deploying the data forwarder with AMP.
</Accordion>






<Accordion title="Azure Managed Prometheus">
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus can be used when deploying AKS clusters.

- Supports Azure Managed Service for Prometheus (AzMP) for container data collection.
- See https://github.com/densify-dev/container-data-collection/tree/main/multi-cluster/examples/azmp for details on deploying the data forwarder with AzMP.
</Accordion>






<Accordion title="Other Observability platforms that support the Prometheus API with basic authentication">
The data forwarder can be setup to connect to Prometheus or an observability platform that supports the Prometheus API with HTTP basic authentication and sends container data from multiple clusters to Densify on an hourly basis.

- Supports Prometheus with basic authentication (e.g., Grafana Cloud)
- See https://github.com/densify-dev/container-data-collection/tree/main/multi-cluster/examples/basic for details on deploying the data forwarder using an observability platform.
