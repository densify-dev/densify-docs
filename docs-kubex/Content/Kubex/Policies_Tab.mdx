Policy settings allow you to consider service levels, business, operational, technical requirements that impact your day-to-day operation and map these considerations to Densify's analytics which then generate recommendations to improve performance and reduce overall cost of running your container environments. Densify provides tunable policies based on industry best practices. 

You can review your policy settings with your account manager, if required.

The Policies report provides details of the policies that are applied to the selected scope of systems. The content of the table is based on your selection in the tree viewer and your view and filter settings.

You can create filters at the column or table level. See [Using Table Column Features](/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/Using_Table_Column_Features).
Two system views provide commonly used reports:


<ul>
  <li>Policy Settings--Shows you commonly used policy settings, their current values and a description.</li>
  <li>Policy Comparison--Shows you policy settings and their current values in a vertical list.</li>
