The Densify metrics viewer allows you to view your collected and analyzed time series data to review specific container details. You can use the metrics viewer to investigate specific utilization details when deciding whether to action specific recommendations.

<ol start="1">
  <li>Select one container to review. The metrics viewer tab is not displayed until only one container is selected.</li>
  <li>Use the tree viewer's search feature to find a specific container. Enter the name of the container, as you type, matching items are displayed in the list.</li>
  <li>Ensure the view and filter settings are set accordingly, to locate your specific container.</li>
</ol>

## Metrics Viewer Controls

When you open the metrics viewer, the instance that was selected in the Instance Optimization Details page is displayed. You can from the tree viewer, or from the AI Analysis Details tab.
You can configure the data you want to view for this container using the options in the dropdown menus.

All of the charts, are refreshed immediately when you change any of the control options. Your settings are saved for the current user session and are returned to the default values if you log out or if another user opens the metrics viewer.
The line chart shows the selected metric plotted by the hour or date.
The X-axis scales based on the amount of data up to the maximum of 90-days. The X-axis will show both date and hour when the date range includes less than 7-days. Only the date is shown when there are more than 7-days of data on the chart.
If you hover over any data point in the graph a popup indicates the values on the selected date. You can slide the mouse along the plotted lines to see data values at the specific date or time.
If metric data is not available, the message NA:  is shown in the legend of the impacted chart.

#### Disk I/O

\* Collecting the metric, container\_fs\_usage\_bytes is an issue if the Kubernetes cluster container uses containerd as its runtime. Since most Kubernetes clusters now use containerd as their runtime and cadvisor does not return the required metrics, you will not see Disk I/O data. If you select this metric you will see "No Data Available".
See the following issues:


<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/2785"> https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/2785 </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/3315"> https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/3315 </a>
  </li>
</ul>


Collection of this metric is supported by both Docker and CRI-O container runtimes.

#### Recommended CPU and Memory Request and Limit Values

When selected, recommended CPU and memory request and limit values are shown as a straight line regardless of which statistics (Peak/Sustained/Average/Min) have been selected.
