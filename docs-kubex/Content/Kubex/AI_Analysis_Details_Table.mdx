Use the AI Analysis Details report to review instance-specific details. The content of the report is defined by your selection in the tree viewer. You can further filter the table content using the options on the column headers and from a flyout menu. See [Using Filters](/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/Using_Filters).

## Pre-Configured Views

The following pre-configured tables are provided to quickly show various issues in your environment. Specific filters have been set and selected columns are displayed to highlight the specified risk or waste issue.

Uptime %
</td>
<td>
Uptime % is the total time the container has been running as a percentage of the total hours since the container was deployed. (Running Hrs/Total Hrs)
When using pay-per-use pricing models, the amount of time each instance has been running, is required to accurately estimate future costs. 
<br/><br/>
The predicted uptime (%) for a cloud instance or container, is based on the percentage of hours CPU utilization data is present in the historical interval, as specified in the policy settings for the entity. For Auto Scaling groups and VM Scale Sets and Individual child instances are not taken into account.
<br/><br/>
Uptime for new instances or containers, that started mid-way through the historical interval, is calculated from the time/date that the instance was started rather than the beginning of the interval, resulting in more accurate predictions for future usage.
<br/><br/>
For example, the uptime is the number of hours that have "CPU Utilization in mcores", and the range is the lesser of when the container was discovered, or the range that is defined in the policy. Looking at a specific container that was discovered on July 5th 2025, that has workload for 42 hours since that date, then 13 days later, the uptime % is 42 hrs/(13 days x 24 hrs/day) = 13.4%. This is the value reported in this column.

Running hours is the number of hours of CPU utilization data from any running containers, as defined by the container manifest.

## Containers with Unspecified Settings

Containers with unspecified request values can lead to misleading savings or shortfall results. In Kubex, costs for containers with unspecified CPU and memory request values, are calculated based on the recommended CPU and memory request values.

The resulting values are then used when calculating the following values on the AI Analysis Details tab:


<ul>
  <li>Cost per container</li>
  <li>Total Cost</li>
  <li>Total Surplus CPU/Mem Request</li>
</ul>


Values for the actual CPU and Memory Request, as shown in the corresponding columns are still shown as '-' for these containers.

These containers are still reported as unspecified in the [histogram](/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/Histograms_Tab) charts, so that you are aware of the risk these containers add to your environment.

## Container Optimization Types

Container recommendations are categorized into optimization types, which are based on recommended sizing for the CPU Request, CPU Limit, Memory Request, and Memory Limit settings. See the table below for a description of each container optimization type.

Just Right
</td>
<td>
This container manifest or task definition is optimally configured for the workload. There are no resizing  recommendations.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style={{backgroundColor:"#F3A147", color:"black", textAlign:"center", verticalAlign:"middle"}}>
Upsize
</td>
<td>
Kubex recommends increasing one or more of CPU Request, CPU Limit, Memory Request, or Memory Limit settings. An "Upsize" optimization type has no recommendations to decrease any container CPU or memory request or limit settings.
For example, Kubex assigns an "Upsize" optimization type if a  container manifest or task definition has the following aggregate optimization recommendations:
<ul>
  <li>Increasing CPU Request setting;</li>
  <li>Keeping CPU Limit and Memory Limit at the same setting;</li>
  <li>Setting a Memory Request from an unspecified value.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style={{backgroundColor:"#DCEEF4", color:"black", textAlign:"center", verticalAlign:"middle"}}>
Downsize
</td>
<td>
Kubex recommends decreasing one or more of CPU Request, CPU Limit, Memory Request, or Memory Limit settings. A "Downsize" optimization type does not have any size increase recommendations for any request or limit settings.
For example, Kubex assigns a "Downsize" optimization types for the following aggregate recommendations:
<ul>
  <li>Decreasing CPU Request and/or CPU Limit settings;</li>
  <li>Keeping Memory Request and Memory Limit at the same setting.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style={{backgroundColor:"#CDA1BA", color:"black", textAlign:"center", verticalAlign:"middle"}}>
Resize
</td>
<td>
Kubex recommends resizing at least two of CPU Request, CPU Limit, Memory Request, or Memory Limit settings. For the "Resize" optimization type, there is at least one increase recommendation and at least one decrease recommendation.
For example, Kubex assigns a "Resize" optimization type if a container has the following recommendations:
<ul>
  <li>Increasing CPU Request setting;</li>
  <li>Keeping  CPU Limit at the current setting;</li>
  <li>Sizing Memory Request from an unspecified value;</li>
  <li>Decreasing Memory Limit from it's current value.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style={{backgroundColor:"#CDBCDE", color:"black", textAlign:"center", verticalAlign:"middle"}}>
Size from Unspecified
</td>
<td>
Sizing recommendations are made without current CPU Request, CPU Limit, Memory Request, and Memory Limit values. For "Size from Unspecified" optimization type, there is at least one sizing recommendation from an unspecified setting and no decreasing or increasing size  recommendations for any container request or limit settings.

For example, Kubex assigns a "Size from Unspecified" optimization type if a container has the following recommendations:

<ul>
  <li>Sizing CPU Request and CPU Limit settings;</li>
  <li>Keeping Memory Request and Memory Limit at the same settings.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style={{textAlign:"center", verticalAlign:"middle"}}>
No Data
</td>
<td>
There is insufficient data to recommend changes to CPU Request, CPU Limit, Memory Request, or Memory Limit values.

## Utilization Charts

The last section provides utilization charts that show hourly min/max and sustained activity for the selected node group. You can also expand any chart to the modal view and select other metrics for review. See [Using the Utilization Charts](/docs-kubex/Content/Kubex/AI_Analysis_Details_Charts#workload-charts-details) for details on using these charts to review workload data.
