## Description

The attribute metadata for the Workload resource object can be retrieved in a single `GET` request. This metadata can be used to display and validate the attributes of the Workload resource object before the Workload object is created. It provides information such as whether or not the attribute is displayed, possible valid values, whether or not a value must be specified, etc. The returned list is by category, with attributes within each category.
