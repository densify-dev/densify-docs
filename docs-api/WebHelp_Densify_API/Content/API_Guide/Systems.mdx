This resource is used to return information about systems loaded through data collection in Densify. These systems do not have to belong to a control environment or a cloud environment, but must be of a supported entity [type](#_type). Returned resource element values match those that are displayed in the Densify Analysis Console from the Data Collection > Discovered System Explorer (DSE) > System Summary or Attributes pages.
