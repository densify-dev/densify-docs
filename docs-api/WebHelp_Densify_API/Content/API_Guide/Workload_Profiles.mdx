## Description

A Workload Profile is a model of the workload behavior of a machine for various workload types.

This resource object is used to retrieve the Workload Profiles and associated representative utilization values/charts. It also includes the representative workloads created from transform scenarios (i.e. see `/workload-profiles/Transform`).

When you create a Workload, you specify the Workload Profile or the expected workload behavior using element `workload_profile`.
