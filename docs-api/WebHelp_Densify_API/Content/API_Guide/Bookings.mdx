## Description

A Booking represents an inbound or outbound host, an inbound datastore, or an inbound or outbound VM.

A Booking object is automatically created with a specified type element when the corresponding resource object is created through the API or UI:

Table: Inbound and Outbound Bookings

<table>
<col/>
<col/>
<col/>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p>booking</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>API</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>UI</p>
</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p>type=INBOUND_GUEST</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>workloads</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span class="mc-variable Document.Res_Console variable">Route and Reserve Demand page</span> or though the Booking Manager </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>type=INBOUND_HOST</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>inbound-hosts</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Plan and Manage Supply page or though the Booking Manager </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>type=INBOUND_DATSTORE</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>inbound-datastores</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Plan and Manage Supply page or though the Booking Manager </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>type=OUTBOUND_HOST</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>outbound-hosts</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span class="mc-variable Document.Control_Console variable">Control Console</span> Spectrum</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The Booking objects are kept in synch with their API counterparts such that any updates made to the API objects are automatically made to the Booking objects, and vice-versa.

<Note>
Only the Booking object is updated on analysis refreshes, with state updates.
