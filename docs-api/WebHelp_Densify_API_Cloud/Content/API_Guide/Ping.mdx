The `/ping` resource is used to check the status of the Densify API subsystem. No credentials are required for this resource to validate the API subsystem. A ping API call performs an end-to-end test from the client to the API subsystem, ensuring that the Densify database is available and is able to respond to requests. Network elements, such as load balancers, can use this resource to verify that the web server receiving the request can be kept as an active participant in the resource pool.
