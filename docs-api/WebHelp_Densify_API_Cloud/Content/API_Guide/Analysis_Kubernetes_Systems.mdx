title: "Analysis: Kubernetes Container Systems"
---

The `/analysis/containers/kubernetes/<analysisId>/systems` resource is used to return a collection of all container systems that were included in the Kubernetes optimization analysis.

The number of analyzed systems (i.e. `/containers/kubernetes/<analysisId>/systems` entities) will always be greater than or equal to the number of system recommendations produced (i.e. `/containers/kubernetes/<analysisId>/results` entities), as some systems may not have any recommendations. See [Analysis: Kubernetes Container Recommendations](./Analysis_Kubernetes_Results) for details of the Kubernetes container recommendation resource.
