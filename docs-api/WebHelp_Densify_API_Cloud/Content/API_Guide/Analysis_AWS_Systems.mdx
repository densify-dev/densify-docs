## Description

The `/analysis/cloud/aws/<analysisId>/systems` resource is used to return a collection of all systems included in an AWS optimization analysis.

The recommendations from an AWSÂ optimization analysis can be obtained using the `/analysis/cloud/aws/<analysisId>/results` resource. See [Analysis: AWS Recommendations](./Analysis_AWS_Results) for details on the AWS recommendations resource.

The number of analyzed systems (i.e. `/aws/<analysisId>/systems` entities) will always be greater than or equal to the number of system recommendations produced (i.e. `/aws/<analysisId>/results` entities), as some systems may not have any recommendations.
