title: "Common Elements"
---

To be consistent across the Densify API, there are some components that are common across all the resources.

## ID, Name and Self Reference (id, name, href)

Every instance of an individual persistent resource is referable via its own URI. Thus each resource instance has a unique ID with a corresponding self link element that any integration code can store to refer back to that element.

In general, each resource object and any reference to a resource object use the following three elements to identify the object:

* `id`--UUID of the resource
* `name`--name of the resource (if applicable)
* `href`--link to the resource

Every collection request returns the above elements of each object in the collection.

<Note>
Densify API elements, parameters, and filters are case-sensitive.

## Date-Time

Date-time elements are specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format, using the UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.
