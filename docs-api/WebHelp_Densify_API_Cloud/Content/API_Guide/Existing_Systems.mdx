sidebarTitle: Overview

This resource is used to return the host and guest systems within Densify. This list matches that returned by the Data Collection >Â Discovered Systems Explorer in the Analysis Console, but only systems that are included in a control environment. Systems that are loaded through data collection but are not analyzed, are not returned by this resource object.

### Sorting By Size

You can sort any collection using the hidden `size` element.

The sort logic is calculated based on the following priority order:

* `memory`
* `total_physical_cpus`
* `cores_per_cpu`

For example, if two hosts have the same total memory, the one with the higher count of total physical CPUs is considered the larger host.

Systems with any "\_Unknown\_" values are sorted at the end of the collection independent of the specified sort order.
