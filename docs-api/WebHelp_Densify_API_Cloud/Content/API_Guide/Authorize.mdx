The `authorize` resource is used to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) for Densify users to make authorized API requests. The resource will return a token for any active Densify user when the proper credentials are provided. Only API-enabled users can make authorized API calls. See [Using the API: Authentication](./Using_the_API#_Authentication) for details on API-enabled users.

The JWT API token is only valid within the expiry time of the token, which by default is set to 60 minutes.

The key used to validate the token is also refreshed every 30 days.

<Note>
To access the Densify API, you need user credentials with membership in the following Densify user group: SaaS\_User\_Admin.or SaaS\_User.

## Security Considerations

The authorization workflow provides a progressively longer delay each time an invalid password is entered in an Authorize request.

This behaviour is applied regardless of whether or not you have enabled the Densify password policy. The workflow does change if the password policy has been enabled. Contact [Support@Densify.com](mailto:Support@Densify.com) for details.
