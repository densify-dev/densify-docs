title: "Subscriptions: Results"
---

The `/subscriptions/<platformType>/<subscriptionRef>` resource is used to dynamically retrieve your latest personalized Densify subscription recommendations. This resource allows you to review your platform-specific subscription results on-demand. The same information is delivered to a third-party application for targeted distribution if the third-party application is defined in the subscription's webhook.

To see how subscriptions are defined, refer to [Subscriptions](./Subscriptions).

## Resource

```
/subscriptions/cloud/<subscriptionRef>
```

```
/subscriptions/containers/<subscriptionRef>
```

```
/subscriptions/<subscriptionRef>
```

<Note>
If you use this resource without the `<platformType>` specified (i.e. without `cloud` or `containers` specified), the behavior is exactly the same as specifying the `cloud`-specific resource. This behavior enables backward compatibility with scripts using the Densify API prior to release 12.1.6, where the platform-specific indicator was not available.
