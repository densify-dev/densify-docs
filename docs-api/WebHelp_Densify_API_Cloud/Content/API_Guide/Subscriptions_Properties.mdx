title: "Subscriptions: Properties"
---

The `/subscriptions/<platformType>/properties` resource is used to store a list of recommendation properties available to the [Subscriptions](./Subscriptions) resource for the purpose of filtering recommendations from the resulting subscription data set.

This resource acts as a catalog of recommendation properties to be referenced by the [propertyReferences](./Subscriptions#propertyReferences) parameter in a subscription. Properties not defined in the `/subscriptions/<platformType>/properties` resource, cannot be referenced by a subscription property filter condition. See [Subscriptions](./Subscriptions) for details on defining a subscription and using property filter conditions.

There is a catalog for each supported `<platformType>`, which can only be referenced by the corresponding `<platformType>` subscription. For example, a container subscription (i.e. `/subscriptions/containers`) can only reference properties from the Container Subscriptions Properties catalog (i.e. `/subscriptions/containers/properties`).

Densify provides a default set of properties for each `<platformType>` catalog. You can extend these default sets by adding additional properties, or you can customize the sets by modify or deleting existing properties.

For the full set of available properties to add to the Cloud Subscriptions Properties catalog, refer to the cloud recommendation response schema:

* See [Analysis: AWS Recommendations: Response](./Analysis_AWS_Results#_ResultElements) for a list of all the recommendation elements available for the AWS instances.
* See [Analysis: Azure Recommendations: Response](./Analysis_Azure_Results#_ResultElements) for a list of all the recommendation elements available for the Azure instances.
* See [Analysis: GCP Recommendations: Response](./Analysis_GCP_Results#_ResultElements) for a list of all the recommendation elements available for the GCP instances.

See [Default Cloud Properties](#DefaultProperties) for the list of default cloud properties.

<Note>
Some recommendation elements are not common to all technologies. It is good practice to indicate the technology for an element that is technology-specific in the [aliasName](#aliasName) (e.g. aliasName = "AWS minGroupRecommended"). This practice is helpful when you use the Cloud Subscriptions Properties catalog to form property conditions.
</Note>

For the full set of available properties to add to the Container Subscriptions Properties catalog, refer to the container recommendation response schema:

* See [Analysis: Kubernetes Container Recommendations: Response](./Analysis_Kubernetes_Results#_ResultElements) for a list of all the recommendation elements available for Kubernetes containers.

See [Default Container Properties](#containerDefaultProperties) for the list of default cloud properties.

Properties in the platform-specific Subscriptions Properties catalogs can be declared as: global or private (i.e. user-specific). Global properties can be used by any API enabled user, while private properties can only be used by their owners. An exception to this rule is that <Tooltip tip="An administrative user is a Densify user in the Administrator user group or with the Analysis Admin role.">administrative users</Tooltip> have access to all properties - global or private user-specific.

## Resource

```
/subscriptions/cloud/properties
```

```
/subscriptions/containers/properties
```

```
/subscriptions/properties
```

<Note>
If you use this resource without the `<platformType>` specified (i.e. without `cloud` or `containers` specified), the behavior is exactly the same as specifying the `cloud`-specific resource. This behavior enables backward compatibility with scripts using the Densify API prior to release 12.1.6, where the platform-specific indicator was not available.
