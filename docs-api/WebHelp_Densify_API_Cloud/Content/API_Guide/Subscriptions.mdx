This resource allows you to set up and schedule the delivery of personalized Densify recommendations to a third-party application for targeted distribution.

Personalization of the recommendation data set (returned subscription notification output) is facilitated by the following mechanisms:

* Return only the systems you are interested in by specifying system attribute conditions with the [tagReferences](#tagReferences) parameter.
* Return only specific recommendations you are interested in by specifying recommendation property conditions with the [propertyReferences](#propertyReferences) parameter.
* Suppress certain systems or recommendations in the returned output, for a period of time, with the [suppressionReferences](#suppressionReferences) parameter.
* Finally, the fields and attributes displayed in the returned output can be customized with the [returnStructure](#returnStructure) parameter. You can specify which recommendation field to display and whether to display the field name or the field alias as the element key.

Subscription notifications are delivered to a third party application, such as Microsoft Teams™ or Slack™, using the [webhook](#webhook)  definition. If you do not specify a webhook in your Subscriptions definition, the notifications are not triggered because there is no delivery location. See [Subscriptions: Status](./Subscriptions_Status) for details on Subscriptions results and webhook status.

You can dynamically retrieve the current personalized Subscriptions recommendations by providing a subscription ID in the GET subscription request. See [Subscriptions: Results](./Subscriptions_Results) for details on retrieving Subscriptions results on-demand.

You can also schedule the frequency of the notification distribution using the [schedule](#schedule) definition parameter. Subscriptions without a schedule definition will typically have notifications triggered nightly after recommendation analysis and reporting database updates.

## Resource

```
/subscriptions/cloud
```

```
/subscriptions/containers
```

```
/subscriptions
```

<Note>
If you use this resource without the `<platformType>` specified (i.e. without `cloud` or `containers` specified), the behavior is exactly the same as specifying the `cloud`-specific resource. This behavior enables backward compatibility with scripts using the Densify API prior to release 12.1.6, where the platform-specific indicator was not available.
